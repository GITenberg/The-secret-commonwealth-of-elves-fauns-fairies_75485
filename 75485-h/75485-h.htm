<h2 class="nobreak" id="INTRODUCTION">INTRODUCTION.</h2>


<h3>I. <span class="smcap">The History of the Book and Author.</span></h3>

<p class="noindent">The bibliography of the following little tract is
extremely obscure. The title-page of the edition
of 1815, which we reproduce, gives the date as
1691. Sir Walter Scott says in his <cite>Demonology
and Witchcraft</cite> (1830, p. 163, note), “It was
printed with the author’s name in 1691, and reprinted,
in 1815, for Longman &amp; Co.” But was
there really a printed edition of 1691? Scott
says that he never met with an example. Research
in our great libraries has discovered none,
and there is none save that of 1815 at Abbotsford.
The reprint, of one hundred copies, was
made, as it states, from no printed text, but from
“a manuscript copy preserved in the Advocates’
Library.” On page 45 of the edition of 1815,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_x">[x]</span>
at the end of the comments on Lord Tarbott’s
Letters, there is a “Note by the Transcriber”—that
is, the person who wrote out the manuscript
in the Advocates’ Library: “See the rest
in a little manuscript belonging to Coline Kirk.”
Now Coline or Colin Kirk, Writer to the Signet,
was the son of the Rev. Mr. Kirk, author of the
tract. If the son had his father’s book only in
manuscript, it seems very probable that it was
not printed in 1691; that the title-page is only
the title-page of a manuscript. Till some printed
text of 1691 is discovered, we may doubt, then,
whether the hundred copies published in 1815,
and now somewhat rare, be not the original
printed edition. The editor has a copy of 1815,
but it is the only one which he has met with
for sale.</p>

<p>The Rev. Robert Kirk, the author of <cite>The
Secret Commonwealth</cite>, was a student of theology
at St. Andrews: his Master’s degree, however,
he took at Edinburgh. He was (and this is
notable) the youngest and <em>seventh</em> son of Mr.
James Kirk, minister of Aberfoyle, the place
familiar to all readers of <cite>Rob Roy</cite>. As a seventh
son, he was, no doubt, specially gifted, and in
<cite>The Secret Commonwealth</cite> he lays some stress on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xi">[xi]</span>
the mystic privileges of such birth. There may
be “some secret virtue in the womb of the
parent, which increaseth until the seventh son
be borne, and decreaseth by the same degree
afterwards.” It would not surprise us if Mr.
Kirk, no less than the Rev. Robert Blair of
St. Andrews (1650-60), could heal scrofula by
the touch, like royal persons—Charles III. in
Italy, for example. As is well known to all,
the House of Brunswick has no such powers.
However this may have been, Mr. Kirk was
probably drawn, by his seventh sonship, to a
more careful study of psychical phenomena than
most of his brethren bestowed. Little is known
of his life. He was minister originally of Balquidder,
whence, in 1685, he was transferred to
Aberfoyle. This was no Covenanting district,
and there is no bigotry in Mr. Kirk’s dissertation.
He was employed on an “Irish” translation
of the Bible, and he published a Psalter
in Gaelic (1684). He married, first, Isobel,
daughter of Sir Colin Campbell of Mochester,
who died in 1680, and, secondly, the daughter
of Campbell of Fordy: this lady survived him.
From his connection with Campbells, we may
misdoubt him for a Whig. By his first wife he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xii">[xii]</span>
had a son, Colin Kirk, W.S.; by his second
wife, a son who was minister of Dornoch. He
died (if he did die, which is disputed) in 1692,
aged about fifty-one; his tomb was inscribed—</p>

<p class="center">
<span class="lsp2">ROBERTUS KIRK</span>, A.M.<br>
Linguæ Hiberniæ Lumen.</p>

<p>The tomb, in Scott’s time, was to be seen in
the east end of the churchyard of Aberfoyle;
but the ashes of Mr. Kirk <em>are not there</em>. His
successor, the Rev. Dr. Grahame, in his <cite>Sketches
of Picturesque Scenery</cite>, informs us that, as Mr.
Kirk was walking on a <em>dun-shi</em>, or fairy-hill, in
his neighbourhood, he sunk down in a swoon,
which was taken for death. “After the ceremony
of a seeming funeral,” writes Scott (<i>op.
cit.</i>, p. 105), “the form of the Rev. Robert
Kirk appeared to a relation, and commanded
him to go to Grahame of Duchray. ‘Say to
Duchray, who is my cousin as well as your own,
that I am not dead, but a captive in Fairyland;
and only one chance remains for my liberation.
When the posthumous child, of which my wife
has been delivered since my disappearance, shall
be brought to baptism, I will appear in the
room, when, if Duchray shall throw over my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xiii">[xiii]</span>
head the knife or dirk which he holds in his
hand, I may be restored to society; but if this
is neglected, I am lost for ever.’” True to his
tryst, Mr. Kirk did appear at the christening,
and “was visibly seen;” but Duchray was so
astonished that he did not throw his dirk over
the head of the appearance, and to society Mr.
Kirk has not yet been restored. This is extremely
to be regretted, as he could now add
matter of much importance to his treatise.
Neither history nor tradition has more to tell
about Mr. Robert Kirk, who seems to have been
a man of good family, a student, and, as his
book shows, an innocent and learned person.</p>


<h3>II. <span class="smcap">The Secret Commonwealth.</span></h3>

<p>The tract, of which the reader now knows the
history, is a little volume of somewhat singular
character. Written in 1691 by the Rev. Robert
Kirk, minister of Aberfoyle, it is a kind of
metaphysic of the Fairy world. Having lived
through the period of the sufferings of the Kirk,
the author might have been expected either to
neglect Fairyland altogether, or to regard it as
a mere appanage of Satan’s kingdom—a “burning<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xiv">[xiv]</span>
question” indeed, for some of the witches
who suffered at Presbyterian hands were merely
narrators of popular tales about the state of the
dead. That she trafficked with the dead, and
from a ghost won a medical recipe for the cure
of Archbishop Adamson of St. Andrews, was
the charge against Alison Pearson. “The
Bischope keipit his castle lyk a tod in his holl,
seik of a disease of grait fetiditie, and oftymes
under the cure of women suspected of witchcraft,
namlie, wha confessit hir to haiff
learnit medecin of ane callit Mr. Wilyeam Simsone,
that apeired divers tymes to hir efter his
dead, and gaiff hir a buik.... She was execut
in Edinbruche for a witch” (James Melville’s
<cite>Diary</cite>, p. 137, 1583). The Archbishop, like
other witches, had a familiar in the form of a
hare, which once ran before him down the
street. These were the beliefs of men of learning
like James, the nephew and companion of
Andrew Melville. Even in our author’s own
time, Archbishop Sharp was accused of entertaining
“the muckle black Deil” in his study at
midnight, and of being “levitated” and dancing
in the air. This last feat, creditable to a saint or
a Neo-Platonist like Plotinus, was reckoned for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xv">[xv]</span>
sin to Archbishop Sharp, as may be read in
Wodrow’s <cite>Analecta</cite>. Thus all Fairydom was
commonly looked on as under the same guilt as
witchcraft. Yet Mr. Kirk of Aberfoyle, living
among Celtic people, treats the land of faery as
a mere fact in nature, a world with its own
laws, which he investigates without fear of the
Accuser of the Brethren. We may thus regard
him, even more than Wodrow, as an early
student in folk-lore and in psychical research—topics
which run into each other—and he
shows nothing of the usual persecuting disposition.
Nor, again, is Mr. Kirk like Glanvil
and Henry More. He does not, save in his
title-page and in one brief passage, make superstitious
creeds or psychical phenomena into
arguments and proofs against modern Sadducees.
Firm in his belief, he treats his matter in a
scientific spirit, as if he were dealing with
generally recognised physical phenomena.</p>

<p>Our study of Mr. Kirk’s little tractate must
have a double aspect. It must be an essay
partly on folk-lore, on popular beliefs, their relation
to similar beliefs in other parts of the
world, and the residuum of fact, preserved by
tradition, which they may contain. On the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xvi">[xvi]</span>
other hand, as mental phenomena are in question—such
things as premonitions, hallucinations,
abnormal or unusual experiences generally—a
criticism of Mr. Kirk must verge on “Psychical
Research.” The Society organised for that
difficult subject certainly takes a vast deal of
trouble about all manner of odd reports and
strange visions. It “transfers” thoughts of no
value, at a great expense of time and of serious
hard work. But, as far as the writer has read
the Society’s Proceedings, it “takes no keep,”
as Malory says, of these affairs in their historical
aspect. Whatever hallucination, or illusion, or
imposture, or the “subliminal self” can do to-day,
has always been done among peoples in
every degree of civilisation. An historical study
of the topic, as contained in trials for witchcraft,
in the reports of travellers and missionaries, in
the works of the seventeenth-century Platonists,
More, Glanvill, Sinclair, and others, and in the
rare tracts such as <cite>The Devil in Glen Luce</cite> and
<cite>The Just Devil of Woodstock</cite>, not to mention
Lavater, Wierus, Thyræus, Reginald Scott, and
so on, is as necessary to the psychologist as to
the folk-lorist.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> If there be an element of fact<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xvii">[xvii]</span>
in modern hypnotic experiments (a matter on
which I have really no opinion), it is plain that
old magic and witchcraft are not mere illusions,
or not commonplace illusions. The subliminal
self has his stroke in these affairs. Assuredly
the Psychologists should have an historical department.
The evidence which they would find
is, of course, vitiated in many obvious ways, but
the evidence contains much that coincides with
that of modern times, and the coincidence can
hardly be designed—that is to say, the old
Highland seers had no design of abetting modern
inquiry. It may be, however, that their methods
and ideas have been traditionally handed down
to modern “sensitives” and “mediums.” At all
events, here is an historical chapter, if it be but
a chapter in “The History of Human Error.”
These wide and multifarious topics can only be
touched on lightly in this essay; the author will
be content if he directs the attention of students
with more leisure and a better library of <i lang="fr">diablerie</i>
to the matter. But first we glance at <cite>The Secret
Commonwealth</cite> as folk-lorists.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_xviii">[xviii]</span></p>


<h3>III. “<span class="smcap">The Subterranean Inhabitants.</span>”</h3>

<p>Mr. Kirk’s first chapter, “Of the Subterranean
Inhabitants,” naturally suggests the recent speculations
of Mr. MacRitchie. The gist of Mr.
MacRitchie’s <cite>Testimony of Tradition</cite> is that
there once was a race of earth-dwellers in this
island; that their artificial caves still exist; that
this people survive in popular memory as “the
legendary Feens,” and as the Pechts of popular
tales, in which they are regarded as dwarfs.
“The Pechs were unco wee bodies, but terrible
strang.” Here, then, it might be thought that
we have the origin of Fairy beliefs. There really
was, on this showing, a dwarf race, who actually
did live in the “fairy-hills,” or howes, now commonly
looked on as sepulchral monuments.</p>

<p>There is much in Mr. MacRitchie’s theory
which does not commend itself to me. The
modern legends of Pechts as builders of Glasgow
Cathedral, for example, do not appear to prove
such a late survival of a race known as Picts, but
are on a level with the old Greek belief that the
Cyclopes built Mycenæ (<cite>Testimony of Tradition</cite>,
p. 72). Granting, for the sake of discussion,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xix">[xix]</span>
that there were still Picts or Pechs in Galloway
when Glasgow Cathedral was built (in the
twelfth century), these wild Galloway men,
scourges of the English Border, were the very
last people to be employed as masons. The
truth is that the recent Scotch have entirely
forgotten the ages of mediæval art. Accustomed
to the ill-built barns of a robbed and stinted
Kirk, they looked on the Cathedral as no work
of ordinary human beings. It was a creation
of the Pechts, as Mycenæ and Tiryns of the
mighty walls were creations of the Cyclopes.
By another coincidence, the well-known story
of the last Pecht, who refuses to divulge the
secret of the heather ale, is told in the Volsunga
Saga, and in the <cite lang="de">Nibelungenlied</cite>, of the Last
Niflung. Again, the breaking of a bar of iron,
which he takes for a human arm, by the last
Pecht is a tale current of the Drakos in modern
Greece (see Chambers’s <cite>Popular Traditions of
Scotland</cite> for the last Pecht). I cannot believe
that the historical Picts were a set of half-naked,
dwarfish savages, hairy men living underground.
These are the topics of Sir Arthur
Wardour and Monkbarns. Mr. W. F. Skene
may be said to have put the historic Picts in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xx">[xx]</span>
their proper place as the ancestors of the Highlanders.
The Pecht of legend answers to the
Drakos and the Cyclopes: the beliefs about his
habits may have been suggested by the tumuli,
still more by the <em>brochs</em>: it seems less probable
that they represent an historical memory. As
to the Irish “Feens,” the topic can only be discussed
by Celtic scholars. But it does not follow,
because the leader of the Feens seemed a dwarf
among giants, that therefore his people were a
dwarfish race.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> The story proves no more than
Gulliver’s Travels.</p>

<p>Once more, we often read in the Sagas of a
hero like Grettir, who opens a howe, has a
conflict with a “barrow-wight,” as Mr. Morris
calls the “howe-dweller,” and wins gold and
weapons. But the dweller in the howe is often
merely the able-bodied ghost of the Norseman,
a known and named character, who is buried
there; he is not a Pecht. Thus, as it seems to
me, the Scotch and Celts possessed a theory of
a legendary people, as did the Greeks. Whether
any actual traditions of an earlier, perhaps a
Finnish race, was at the bottom of the legend,
is an obscure question. But, having such a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxi">[xxi]</span>
belief, the Scotch easily discovered homes for
the fancied people in the sepulchral howes:
they “combined their information.” The Fairies,
again, are composite creatures. As they came
to births and christenings, and as Norse wise-wives
(as in the Saga of Eric the Red) prophesied
at festivals, Mr. MacRitchie combines his
own information. The Wise-wife is a Finn
woman, and Finn and Fairy amalgamate. But
the Egyptians, as in the <cite>Tale of Two Brothers</cite>
(Maspero, <cite lang="fr">Contes Egyptiens</cite>), had their Hathors,
who came and prophesied at births; the Greeks
had their Mœræ, as in the story of Meleager
and the burning brand. The Hathors and
Mœræ play, in ancient Egypt and in ancient
Greece, the part of Fairies at the christening,
but surely they were not Finnish women! In
short, though a memory of some old race may
have mingled in the composite Fairy belief, this
is at most but an element in the whole, and the
part played by ancestral spirits, naturally earth-dwellers,
is probably more important. Bishop
Callaway has pointed out, in the preface to his
<cite>Zulu Tales</cite>, that what the Highlanders say of
the Fairies the Zulus say of “the Ancestors.”
In many ways, as when persons carried off to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxii">[xxii]</span>
Fairyland meet relations or friends lately deceased,
who warn them, as Persephone and
Steenie Steenson were warned, to eat no food
in this place, Fairyland is clearly a memory of
the pre-Christian Hades. There are other elements
in the complex mass of Fairy tradition,
but Chaucer knew “the Fairy Queen Proserpina,”
as Campion calls her, and it is plain
that in very fact “the dread Persephone,” the
“Queen over death and the dead,” had dwindled
into the lady who borrows Tamlane in the
ballad. Indeed Kirk mentions but does not
approve of this explanation, “that those subterranean
people are departed souls.” Now, as
was said, the dead are dwellers under earth.
The worshippers of Chthonian Demeter (Achaia)
beat the earth with wands; so does the Zulu
sorcerer when he appeals to the Ancestors. And
a Macdonald in Moidart, being pressed for his
rent, beat the earth, and cried aloud to his dead
chief, “Simon, hear me; you were always good
to me.”<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxiii">[xxiii]</span></p>


<h3>IV. <span class="smcap">Fairyland and Hades.</span></h3>

<p>Thus, to my mind at least, the <em>Subterranean
Inhabitants</em> of Mr. Kirk’s book are not so much
a traditional recollection of a real dwarfish race
living underground (a hypothesis of Sir Walter
Scott’s), as a lingering memory of the Chthonian
beings, “the Ancestors.” A good case in point
is that of Bessie Dunlop, of Dalry, in Ayrshire,
tried on 8th November 1576 for witchcraft.
She dealt in medicine and white
magic, and obtained her prescriptions from
Thomas Reid, slain at Pinkie fight (1547), who
often appeared to her, and tried to lead her
off to Fairyland. She, like Alison Pearson, was
“convict and burnt” (Scott’s <cite>Demonology</cite>, p.
146, and Pitcairn’s <cite>Criminal Trials</cite>). Both
ladies knew the Fairy Queen, and Alison Pearson
beheld Maitland of Lethington, and Buccleugh,
in Fairyland, as is recounted in a rhymed satire
on Archbishop Adamson (Dalzell’s <cite>Scottish Poems</cite>,
p. 321). These are excellent proofs that Fairyland
was a kind of Hades, or home of the dead.</p>

<p>Mr. Kirk, who speaks of the <em>Sleagh Maith</em> as
confidently as if he were discussing the habits
of some remote race which he has visited, credits<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxiv">[xxiv]</span>
them, as the Greek gods were credited, with
the power of nourishing themselves on some fine
essential part of human sacrifice, of human food,
“some fine spirituous Liquors, that peirce like
pure Air and Oil, on the poyson or substance of
Corns and Liquors.” Others, more gross, steal
the actual grain, “as do Crowes and Mice.”
They are heard hammering in the howes: as
Brownies they enter houses and cleanse the
hearths. They are the Domovoys, as the Russians
call them. John Major, in his exposition
of St. Matthew (1518, fol. xlviii.), gives perhaps
the oldest account of Brownies, in a believing
temper. Major styles them Fauni or <em>brobne</em>.
They thrash as much grain in one night as
twenty men could do. They throw stones about
among people sitting by the fire. Whether they
can predict future events is doubtful (see Mr.
Constable in Major’s <cite>Greater Britain</cite>, p. xxx.
Edinburgh, 1892). To us they seem not much
remote from the Roman Lares—spirits of the
household, of the hearth. In all these creatures
Mr. Kirk recognises “an abstruse People,” who
were before our more substantial race, whose
furrows are still to be seen on the hill-tops.
They never were, to his mind, plain palpable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxv">[xxv]</span>
folk; they are only visible, in their quarterly
flittings, to men of the second sight. That gift
of vision includes not only power to see distant
or future events, but the viewless forms of air.
To shun the flittings, men visit church on the
first Sunday of the quarter: then they will be
hallowed against elf-shots, “these Arrows that
fly in the dark.” As is well known, superstition
explained the Neolithic arrow-heads as Fairy
weapons; it does not follow that a tradition of a
Neolithic people suggested the belief in Fairies.
But we cannot deny absolutely that some such
memory of an earlier race, a shy and fugitive
people who used weapons of stone, may conceivably
play its part in the Fairy legend.</p>

<p>Thence Mr. Kirk glides into that singular
theory of savage metaphysics which somewhat
resembles the Platonic doctrine of Ideas. All
things, in Red Indian belief, have somewhere
their ideal counterpart or “Father.” Thus a
donkey, when first seen, was regarded as “the
Father” or archetype “of Rabbits.” Now the
second-sighted behold the “Double-man,” “Doppel-ganger,”
“Astral Body,” “Wraith,” or what
you will, of a living person, and that is merely
his counterpart in the abstruse world. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxvi">[xxvi]</span>
industry of the Psychical Society has collected
much material—evidence, whatever its value, for
the existence of the Double-man. We may call it
a hallucination, which does not greatly increase
our knowledge. From personal experience, and
the experience of friends, I am constrained to
believe that we may think we see a person who
is not really present to the view—who may be
in the next room, or downstairs, or a hundred
miles off. This experience has occurred to the
sane, the unimaginative, the healthy, the free
from superstition, and in circumstances by no
means mystic—for example, when the person
supposed to be seen was not dying, nor distressed,
nor in any but the most normal condition. Indeed,
the cases when there was nothing abnormal
in the state of the person seen are far more
numerous, in my personal knowledge, than those
in which the person seen was dying, or dead, or
excited. The reverse appears to be the rule in
the experience of the Psychical Society. “The
actual proportion of coincidental to non-coincidental
cases, after all deduction for possible
sources of error, was in fact such that the probability
against the supposition of chance coincidence
became enormous, on the assumption of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxvii">[xxvii]</span>
ordinary accuracy on the part of informants”
(Professor Sidgwick, <cite>Proc. S.P.R.</cite>, vol. viii.
p. 607). Some 17,000 answers were collected.
We must apparently accept these facts as not
very abnormal nor very unusual, and doubtless
as capable of some subjective explanation.
But when such things occurred among
imaginative and uneducated Highlanders, they
became foundations and proofs of the doctrine
of second sight—proofs, too, of the primitive
metaphysical doctrine of counterparts and <em>correspondances</em>.
“They avouch that every Element
and different state of Being have Animals resembling
these of another Element.” By persons
not knowing this, “the Roman invention of
guardian Angels particularly assigned” has been
promulgated. The guardian Angel of the Roman
superstition is merely the Double or Co-walker—the
type (in the viewless world) of the man
in the apparent world. Thus are wraiths and
ghosts explained by our Presbyterian psychologist
and his Highland flock. All things universally
have their types, their reflex: a man’s
type, or reflex, or “co-walker” may be seen at a
distance from or near him during his life—nay,
may be seen after his death. The gifted man of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxviii">[xxviii]</span>
second sight can tell the substantial figure from
the airy counterpart. Sometimes the reflex
anticipates the action of the reality: “was often
seen of old to enter a House, by which the people
knew that the Person of that Likeness was to
visit them in a few days.” It may have occurred
to most of us to meet a person in the street
whom we took for an acquaintance. It is not
he, but we meet the real man a few paces farther
on. Thus a distinguished officer, at home on
leave, met a friend, as he tells me, in Piccadilly.
The other passed without notice: the officer
hesitated about following him, did not, and in
some fifty yards met his man. There is probably
no more in this than resemblance and
coincidence, but this is the kind of thing which
was worked by the Highlanders into their metaphysics.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>The end of the Co-walker is obscure. “This<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxix">[xxix]</span>
Copy, Echo, or living Picture goes att last to
his own Herd.” Thus Ghosts are short-lived,
and, according to M. d’Assier on the Manners
of Posthumous Man (<cite lang="fr">L’Homme Posthume</cite>),
seldom survive for more than a century. By an
airy being of this kind the Highlanders explained
the false or morbid appetite. A “joint-eater”
inhabited the patient; “he feeds two when he
eats.” As a rule, the Fairies get their food as
witches do—take “the Pith and Milk from
their Neighbours’ Cows unto their own chiese-hold,
throw a Hair-tedder, at a great distance,
by Airt Magic, only drawing a spigot fastened
in a Post, which will bring Milk as farr as a
Bull will be heard to roar.” This is illustrated
in the drinking scene in <cite>Faust</cite>. This kind of
charge is familiar in trials for witchcraft.</p>

<p>In accordance with the whole metaphysics of
the system of doubles, which are parasites on
humanity, is the superstition of nurses stolen by
Fairies, and of children kidnapped while changelings
are left in their place. The latter accounts
for sudden decline and loss of health by a child;
he is not the original child, but a Fairy brat.
To guard against this, bread (as human food
hateful to Fairies—so the Kanekas carry a boiled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxx">[xxx]</span>
yam about at night), or the Bible, or iron is
placed in the bed of childbirth. “Iron scares
spirits,” as the scholiast says of the drawn sword
of Odysseus in Hades. The Fairy bride, in
Wales, vanishes on being touched with iron.
This belief probably came in when iron was a
new, rare, and mysterious metal. The mortal
nurses in Fairyland are pleasantly illustrated by
the ballad</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indentq">“I heard a cow lowe,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A bonny, bonny cow lowe,”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">in C. Kirkpatrick Sharpe’s <cite>Ballad Book</cite>.<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> This
part of the superstition is not easy to elucidate.
Kirk repeats the well-known tales of the blinding
of the mortal who saw too clearly “by making
use of their Oyntments.” Well-known examples
occur in Gervase of Tilbury, and are cited in
Scott’s note on <i>Tamlane</i> in the <cite>Border Minstrelsy</cite>.
As Homer fables of the dead, their
speech is a kind of whistling like the cry of
bats—another indication of the pre-Christian
Hades.<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> They have feasts and burials; and
Pashley, in his <cite>Travels in Crete</cite>, tells the well-known
Border story of a man who fired on a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxxi">[xxxi]</span>
Fairy bridal, and heard a voice cry, “Ye have
slain the bonny bridegroom.” It is, of course,
to be noted that the modern Greek superstition
of the Nereids, who carry off mortal girls to
dance with them till they pine away, answers to
some of our Fairy legends, while it will hardly
be maintained that the Nereids are a memory of
pre-historic Finns. “Antic corybantic jollity”
is a note of Nereids, as well as of the <em>Sleagh
Maith</em>. “The Inconvenience of their <em>succubi</em>,”
the Fairy girls who make love to young men, is
well known in the Breton ballad, <cite lang="fr">Le Sieur Nan</cite>.
The same superstition is current among the
Kanekas of New Caledonia. My cousin, Mr.
Atkinson, was visited by a young Kaneka, who
twice or thrice returned to take leave of him
with much emotion. When Mr. Atkinson asked
what was the matter, the lad said that he had
just met, as he thought, the girl of his heart
in the forest. After a scene of dalliance she
vanished, and he knew that she was a forest
Fairy, and that he must die in three days,
which he did. This is the “inconvenience of
their succubi,” regretted by Mr. Kirk. Thus it
appears that the mass of these opinions is not
local, nor Celtic merely, but of world-wide<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxxii">[xxxii]</span>
diffusion. Thus Sir Walter Scott observes of the
Afghans and Highlanders, “Their superstitions
are the same, or nearly so. The <em>Gholée Beabacan</em>
(demons of the desert) resemble the <em>Boddach</em> of
the Highlanders, ‘who walked the heath at
midnight and at noon’” (<cite>Quarterly Review</cite>, xiv.
289). Again, Mr. Kirk says that “Were-wolves
and Witches’ true Bodies are (by the union of
the spirit of Nature that runs thorow all, echoing
and doubling the Blow towards another) wounded
at home, when the astrial or assumed Bodies are
stricken elsewhere.” Thus, if a witch-hare is
shot, the witch’s real body is hurt in the same
part; and Lafitau, in North America, found that
when a Huron shot a witch-bird, the real magician
was stricken in the same place. The theory
that the Fairies appear as “a little rough Dog”
is illustrated by the Welsh Dogs of Hell.
<cite>Blackwood’s Magazine</cite> for 1818 contains many
examples of these Hell-dogs, which are often
invested in a sheet of fire, as Rink says is the
case among the Eskimo. Take a modern instance.
“Mr. F. A. Paley and friend, walking
home at night on a lonely road, see a large black
dog rise from it, slowly walk to the side, and
disappear. They search in vain. Mr. Paley<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxxiii">[xxxiii]</span>
hears subsequently that this mysterious dog is
the terror of the neighbourhood, but no such
real dog is known.” Date, summer 1837 (<cite>Journ.
of S.P.R.</cite>, Feb. 1893, p. 31).</p>

<p>The dwellings of these airy shadows of mankind
are, naturally, “Fairie Hills.” There is
such a hill, the Fairy Hill at Aberfoyle, where
Mr. Kirk resided: Baillie Nicol Jarvie describes
its legends in an admirable passage in <cite>Rob Roy</cite>.
Mr. MacRitchie says, “How much of this ‘howe’
is artificial, or whether any of it is, remains to
be discovered.” It is much larger than most
artificial tumuli. According to Mr. Kirk, the
Highlanders “superstitiously believe the souls
of their Predecessors to dwell” in the fairy-hills.
“And for that end, say they, a Mote or Mount
was dedicate beside every Churchyard, to receive
the souls till their adjacent bodies arise, and so
become as a Fairy hill.” Here the Highland
philosophers have conspicuously put the cart
before the horse. The tumuli are much older
than the churches, which were no doubt built
beside them because the place had a sacred
character. Two very good examples may be
seen at Dalry, on the Ken, in Galloway, and at
Parton, on Loch Ken. The grassy howes are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxxiv">[xxxiv]</span>
large and symmetrical, and the modern Presbyterian
churches occupy old sites; at Parton
there are ruins of the ancient Catholic church.
Round the tumulus at Dalry, according to the
local form of the <i lang="de">Märchen</i> of Hesione, a great
dragon used to coil in triple folds, before it was
killed by the blacksmith. Nobody, perhaps,
can regard these tumuli, and many like them,
as anything but sepulchral. On the road between
Balantrae, in Ayrshire, and Stranraer, there is a
beautiful tumulus above the sea, which at once
recalls the barrow above the main that Elpenor
in the <cite>Odyssey</cite>, asked Odysseus to build for him,
“the memorial of a luckless man.” In the
<cite>Argonautica</cite> of Apollonius Rhodius, the ghost
of a hero who fell at Troy appears to the adventurers
on a tumulus like this of the Ayrshire
coast. In speaking of these barrows Mr. Kirk
tells how, during a famine about 1676, two
women had a vision of a treasure hid in a fairy-hill.
This they excavated, and discovered some
coins “of good money.” The great gold corslet
of the British Museum is said to have been
found in Wales, where tradition spoke of a ghost
in golden armour which haunted a hillock. The
hillock was excavated, and the golden corslet,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxxv">[xxxv]</span>
like the Shakespearian bricks, is “alive to
testify” to the truth of the story.</p>


<h3>V. <span class="smcap">Fairies and Psychical Research.</span></h3>

<p>The Fairy belief, we have said, is a composite
thing. On the materials given by tradition,
such as the memory, perhaps, of a pre-historic
race, and by old religion, as in the thoughts
about the pre-Christian Hades, poetry and fancy
have been at work. Consumption, lingering
disease, unexplained disappearances, sudden
deaths, have been accounted for by the agency
of the Fairies, or People of Peace. If the
superstition included no more than this, we
might regard it as a natural result of imagination,
dealing with facts quite natural in the
ordinary course of things. But there are elements
in the belief which cannot be so easily
dismissed. We must ask whether the abnormal
phenomena which have been so frequently discussed,
fought over, forgotten, and revived, do
not enter into the general mass of folk-lore.
They appear most notably in the two branches
of Browniedom—of “Pixies,” as they say in
Devonshire, who haunt the house, and in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxxvi">[xxxvi]</span>
alleged examples of the second sight. The
former topic is the more obscure, if not the
more curious. Let us examine the occurrences,
then, which may have begotten the belief in
Brownies, and in house-haunting Pixies or
Fairies. These appearances may be alleged, on
one hand, to be actual facts in Nature, the
workings of some yet unexplained forces; or
they may merely be the consequences of some
very old traditional method of imposture, vulgar
in itself, but still historical. That form of imposture,
again, may be wrought either by conscious
agents, or unconsciously and automatically
by persons under the influence of somnambulism;
or, finally, the phenomena may in various cases
be due to any one of these three agencies, all of
which may possibly be <i lang="la">veræ causæ</i>, as conscious
imposture and trickery is certainly one <i lang="la">vera
causa</i>.</p>

<p>In Mr. Kirk’s book we meet “the invisible
Wights which haunt Houses, ... throw great
Stones, Pieces of Earth and Wood at the Inhabitants,”
but “hurt them not at all.” As we
have said, Major (1518) calls these wights
“Fauni or Brobne”—that is, Brownies—and
says that they thrash as much grain in one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxxvii">[xxxvii]</span>
night as twenty men could do, and throw
stones about. The legend of their working was
common in Scotland, and a correspondent says
that in Devonshire the belief in Pixies who set
the house in order exists among the grand-parents
of the present generation. But the
sportive is more common than the kindly aspect
of Brownies. Through history we constantly
find them causing objects to move without
visible contact, and “acting in sport, like Buffoons
and Drolls.” In his <cite>Letters on Demonology</cite>
(p. 377) Scott gives instances where the buffoon
or droll was detected, and confessed that the
rattlings of plates and movements of objects
were caused by an apparatus of threads or horse-hair.
He also quotes the famous doings of
“The Just Devil of Woodstock” in 1649, which
so perplexed and discomfited the Cromwellian
Commissioners. He accounts for those annoyances
by the confessions of Joe Collins of Oxford,
“Funny Joe,” which he quotes from Hone’s
<cite>Every-Day Book</cite>, while Hone quotes from the
<cite>British Magazine</cite> of 1747. But the writer in
the <cite>British Magazine</cite> gives no references or
authorities for the authenticity of Funny Joe’s
confessions, nor even for the existence of Joseph.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxxviii">[xxxviii]</span>
Scott could not find his original in the pamphlets
of the British Museum, and some of the statements
attributed to Joe do not tally with the
official account, and other contemporary documents
collected in Sir Walter’s <cite>Woodstock</cite>. Joe
pretends, for example, to have been secretary to
the Commission under the name of Giles Sharpe;
but in the other accounts the secretary is named
Browne. A Royalist Brownie or Polter-geist
lies under shrewd suspicion, but Joe’s own
existence is unproved, and his alleged evidence
is of no value. However, no sane person can
dream of doubting that many a Brownie has
been as much in flesh and blood as the Brownie
of Bodsbeck in Hogg’s story.</p>

<p>There remain the less easily explicable tales
of strange and humorous disturbances, accompanied
by loud sounds, rappings, the moving of
objects without visible contact, and so forth.<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
Perhaps we may best examine these by taking
modern instances, collected by the Psychical
Society, in the first place, and then comparing
them with cases recorded at distant times and
in remote places. Some curious common features<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxxix">[xxxix]</span>
will be observed, and the evidence has at least
the value of undesigned coincidence. Glanvil,
Telfair (minister of Rerrick), the Wesleys, Dr.
Adam Clarke, Increase Mather, were not modern
students of psychical research. The modern
Psychical Researchers, we fear, are not students
of old legendary lore, which they dismiss on
evidence not first-hand nor scientifically valid.
Thus they do not seem to be aware that they
are describing, almost in identical terms, phenomena
identical with those noted by Telfair,
Mather, Lavater, and the rest, and by those
ancients attributed to devils. The modern recorders
are not consciously copying from old
accounts; the coincidences therefore have their
value, as proving that certain phenomena have
occurred and recurred. Now those phenomena
may be due to conscious or to hysterical imposture,
but they have been frequent and common
enough to keep alive, and probably to originate,
a part of the Fairy belief—that part which is
concerned with Brownies and house-haunting
Pixies, or Domovoys. These, again, correspond
to the tricky beings described by Mr. Leland in
his <cite>Etruscan Remains</cite> as survivals of old Roman
and Etruscan popular religions, while we find<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xl">[xl]</span>
similar occurrences in the Empire of the Incas
not long after the Spanish conquest of Peru.<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>Beginning, then, with what is nearest to us in
time, we take Mr. F. W. H. Myers’s essays “On
the Alleged Movement of Objects without Contact,
occurring not in the Presence of a Paid
Medium.”<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> The alleged phenomena are, of
course, as common as blackberries in the presence
of paid mediums, but are to the last degree
untrustworthy. Even when there is no paid
medium present, the mere contagious excitement
which is said to be developed at <i lang="fr">séances</i> makes
all that is thought to occur there a story to be
taken with plenty of salt.<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> One of Mr. Myers’s
examples was the result of <i lang="fr">séances</i>, but it had
features of great importance for the argument.
It will be found in <cite>Proc. S. P. R.</cite>, vol. xix. p. 189,
July 1891. The performers are Mr. C., Mrs.
C., and Mr. H. Mr. C. and Mrs. C. are spoken
of as good witnesses, known to Mr. Myers and
Professor Barrett. Mr. H.’s health has suffered
so much that he cannot be examined, and Mr.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xli">[xli]</span>
H. is the person who interests us here, for
reasons which will be given later. All three
were “unbelievers” in these matters. On the
second evening “lights floated about the room,”
which was lit, apparently, by a full moon.
“F.” (who is also “H.”) felt cold hands touching,
and “hands” recur in the old pre-scientific
accounts. The three mages were holding hands
tightly at the time. Now Mr. H. had hitherto
been in excellent health, but after his chair was
dragged from under him, and he was “thrown
down on the ground,” he went into “a trance.”
His watch and ring (on the finger of a hand held
by Mrs. C.) were carried to a remote part of
the room. H. leaves the circle and sits at the
window. Another figure walks through the
room. H. returns, is “thrown down,” his coat
is dragged off, and his boots are discovered on a
distant sofa. He asks for “something from
home,” goes into a trance, a photograph locked
up by him at home is found on the table. His
wife, in town, “being quite ignorant of our
having had <i lang="fr">séances</i>, told us that, at that very
hour, a fearful crash occurred in his bedroom.
The photograph vanished, and returned last
night, when H. was in a trance.” He is “thrown<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xlii">[xlii]</span>
down” again. He has “alternate fits of unconsciousness
and raving delirium.” The home of
Mr. and Mrs. C. (not the house where they sat)
is vexed by “figures,” noises, knockings; “we
were sprinkled with water in the night,” haunted
by sounds of drums and horns, and so forth.
Before a “manifestation,” “we all felt a sudden
chill, like either a wave of intensely cold air
passing, or a rapid decrease of temperature.”<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>This is a disgusting story if Mr. H.’s health
was ruined by his presence at the performances.
The point, however, is that he did behave in
epileptic fashion while these events were in
progress. It is natural to suppose that, in his
“trances,” he may have been capable, unconsciously,
of feats physically and morally impossible
to him in his normal condition. This
explanation would not cover all the alleged occurrences,
but would account for many of them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_xliii">[xliii]</span></p>

<p>We now take an ancient instance, similar
disturbances at Newberry, in New England, in
1679, similarly accompanied by the presence of
an epileptic patient.<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> The house of William
Morse was “strangely disquieted by a dæmon.”
The inmates were Morse, his wife, and their
grandson, a boy whose age is not given. The
trouble began on December 3, with a sound of
heavy objects falling on the roof. On December
8, large stones and bricks “were thrown in at
the west end of the house ... the bedstead
was lifted up from the floor, and the bed-staff
flung out of the window, and a cat was hurled
at the wife. A long staff danced up and down
in the chimney. The man’s wife put the staff
in the fire, but she could not hold it there, inasmuch
as it would forcibly fly out; yet after
much ado, with joynt strength, they made it to
burn.... A chair flew about, and at last
lighted on the table, where victuals stood ready
to eat, and was likely to spoil all, only by a
nimble catching they saved some of their meat....
A chest was removed from place to place,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xliv">[xliv]</span>
no hand touching it. Two keys would fly
about, making a loud noise by knocking against
each other.... As they lay in bed with their
little boy between them, a great stone from the
floor of the loft was thrown upon the man’s
stomach, and he turning it down upon the floor,
it was once more thrown upon him.” On January
23, 1680, “his ink-horn was taken away
from him while he was writing” (he was keeping
a diary of these events), “and when by all his
seeking he could not find it, at last he saw it
drop out of the air, down by the fire....
February 2, while he and his boy were eating of
cheese, the pieces which he cut were wrested from
them.... But as for the boy, he was a great
sufferer in these afflictions, for on the 18th of
December he, sitting by his grandfather, was
hurried into great motions. The man made him
stand between his legs, but the chair danced
up and down, and was like to have cast both
man and boy into the fire, and the child was
tossed about in such a manner as that they
feared his brains would have been beaten out.”</p>

<p>All these contortions of the boy were apparently
what M. Charcot calls <em>clownisms</em>.<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> When<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xlv">[xlv]</span>
taken to a doctor’s house the boy “was free of
disturbances,” which returned with his return
home. He barked like a dog, clucked like a hen,
talked nonsense about “Powel,” who pinched
and bullied him. While he was in bed with
the old people, “a pot with its contents was
thrown upon them.” They were clutched by
hands, like Mr. and Mrs. C. Once a voice was
heard singing, “Revenge, revenge is sweet.”
Finally a mate of a ship came, declared that the
grandmother was not rightly suspected as a
witch, and offered, if he were left alone with
the boy, to cure him. “The mate came next
day betimes, and the boy was with him till
night; since which time his house, Morse saith,
has not been molested with evil spirits.” Probably
the mate used a rope’s end: the boy was
more speedily cured than Mr. H.</p>

<p>The phenomena are those of droll or buffooning
wights, as Mr. Kirk says, and no man can
doubt that the boy was at the bottom of the
whole affair. But whether he was capable, when
well and conscious, of such diversions, is another
question. Children like him produced the famous
witch-mania in New England.</p>

<p>We have here, undeniably, a well-recorded<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xlvi">[xlvi]</span>
case, analogous to that of Mr. H. In a modern
case of bell-ringing, heavy thumps, and movement
of objects, the agent was “a young girl
who had never been out to service before,”
and who passed the night in a state of wildly
agitated somnambulism, repeating the whole of
the Service for the day.<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> Mather gives several
other examples, in which motives for trickery
are manifest, while we hear nothing of an epileptic
or hysterical patient.</p>

<p>In the majority of instances, ancient or modern,
children are the agents. Thus we have “Physical
Phenomena obtained in a Family Circle,”
that of Mr. and Mrs. Davis, with their children,
at Rio Janeiro.<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> The time was 1888. Curiosity
had been caused by “the notorious Henry Slade.”
There were “touches and grasps of hands.” A
table “ran after me” (Professor Alexander) “and
attempted to hem me in,” when only C., a little
girl, was in the room. “As far as I could see,
she did not even touch the table.” The chair
of Amy (aged thirteen months) was moved about,
like that of Master Morse two hundred years
earlier. A table jumped into the laps of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xlvii">[xlvii]</span>
public. There were raps and thumps, which
“seemed to shake the whole building.” Lights
floated about. A slate, covered with flour, was
placed on C.’s lap; her hands lay on the table.
Marks of fingers came on the flour, and, in
answer to request, the mark of “a naked baby
foot.” The children present were wearing laced
boots, and we are not told that little Amy was
under the table. Bluish lights and the phantasm
of a dog were seen.</p>

<p>All this answers to an ancient example—the
disturbances in Mr. Wesley’s house at Epworth,
December 1715 to January 1716.<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> The house
was a new one, rebuilt in 1709. We have Mr.
Samuel Wesley’s Journal, with many contemporary
letters from members of the family, and
later reminiscences. There were many lively
girls in the house, and two servants—a maid
and a man, recently engaged. The disturbances
began with groanings; then came knockings,
which flitted about the house. Mr. Wesley
heard nothing till December 21. The knocks
replied to those made by the family, but they
never could imitate the sounds. Mrs. Wesley<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xlviii">[xlviii]</span>
and Emily saw an object “like a badger” run
from under a bed and vanish. The mastiff was
much alarmed by the sounds. Mr. Wesley was
“thrice pushed by invisible power.” The bogie
was a Jacobite, as was Mrs. Wesley: Mr. Wesley
was for King George. The knocks were violent
when that usurper was prayed for. They did
not try praying for King James. Robin, the servant,
saw a hand-mill work violently. “Naught
vexed me but that it was empty. I thought,
had it but been full of malt, he might have
ground his heart out for me.” But this was a
jocose, not an industrious devil. Robin called
it “old Jeffries,” after a gentleman lately dead;
the family called it “Jeffrey,” unless one name
is a mere misspelling. It “seemed to sweep
after” Nancy Wesley, when she swept the
chambers. “She thought he might have done
it for her, and saved her the trouble.” Mrs.
Wesley concealed the matter from her husband,
“lest he should fancy it was against his own
death” (Letter of January 12, 1716-17). This
belief in noises foretelling death is very common;
compare Scott’s nocturnal disturbances at Abbotsford
when Bullock, his agent in building it, was
dying in London. The racket occurred on April<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xlix">[xlix]</span>
28 and 29, 1818, and Scott examined the scene
“with Beardie’s broadsword under my arm.”<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>
Bullock died in Tenterden Street, in London,
whether on April 28 or 29 is not easily to be
ascertained. “The noise resembled half a dozen
men putting up boards and furniture, and nothing
can be more certain than that there was nobody
on the premises at the time.”<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> The noises used
to follow Hetty Wesley, and thump under her
feet, as under those of C. in Professor Alexander’s
narrative. Mr. Wesley’s plate “danced
before him on the table a pretty while, without
anybody’s stirring the table.”<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> The disturbances
quieted down in January, but recurred on March
31. Similar phenomena had occurred “long
before” in the family.<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> “The sound very often
seemed in the air, in the middle of a room,
nor could they ever make any such themselves
by any contrivance.”<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> On February 16, 1740,
twenty-three years later, Emily writes to Jack
about “that <em>wonderful thing</em> called by us <em>Jeffrey</em>.... That<span class="pagenum" id="Page_l">[l]</span>
something calls on me against any
extraordinary new affliction.”</p>

<p>Priestley styles this affair “the best-authenticated
that is anywhere extant.” He supposes it
to have been “a trick of the servants, for mere
amusement.” The <i lang="la">modus operandi</i> is difficult to
explain. We hear nothing of bad health or
hysterics in the household.<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> For our purpose it
is enough that a few incidents of this kind, however
produced, might originate and keep alive
the belief in Brownies, and</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent8">“That shrewd and knavish sprite</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Called Robin Goodfellow,”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">who</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indentq">“Frights the maidens of the villagery,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Skims milk, and sometimes labours in the quern.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>By a curious coincidence, we can show a case
in which phenomena of the kind usually reported
as occurring at <i lang="fr">séances</i>, and in examples like that
of William Morse, were actually accepted as
manifestations of the <em>Sleagh Maith</em>, or Fairies.
In his account of the disturbances in the Wesley
family, Dr. Clarke, the author, averred that he
had himself witnessed similar events. It thus
became necessary to consult his <cite>Life</cite> (London,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_li">[li]</span>
1833). “In the history of my own life,” says
Dr. Clarke, “I have related this matter in sufficient
detail.”<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> Unluckily, in his <cite>Life</cite> (pp. 76,
77) he gives scarce any details. Previous to
sudden deaths in a family called Church, the
phenomena of falling plates, heavy tread, and
other noises occurred. Mr. Clarke “sat up one
whole night in the kitchen, and most distinctly
heard the above noises.” He was a born mystic,
and even in childhood a reader of Cornelius
Agrippa, and, later, of the alchemists. But he
records the instance of a woman, who solemnly
declared to Mrs. Clarke that a number of the
<em>gentle people</em> (<em>Sleagh Maith</em>) “occasionally frequented
her house; that they often conversed
with her, one of them putting its hands on her
eyes during the time, which hands she represented,
from the sensation she had, to be about
the size of those of a child of four or five years
of age.” The family were “worn down” with
these visits, and from the mention of touches of
hands it is pretty plain that we have to do with
the kind of sprite who paws people at <i lang="fr">séances</i>.
But these sprites are recognised (the scene is the
North of Ireland) as “gentle people,” Folk of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_lii">[lii]</span>
Peace. The amusing thing is, that Mr. Clarke,
while he believes in Mr. Wesley’s Jeffrey, and
in the supernatural origin of a noise in a kitchen,
laughs at similar phenomena when assigned to
Fairies. It is a mere difference of terminology.</p>

<p>Another old example may be given. It is
Alexander Telfair’s “True Relation” of disturbances
at Ringcroft, in the parish of Rerrick.<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>
The story is attested by the signatures of Ewart,
minister of Kells, in Galloway; Monteith, minister
of Borg; Murdoch, minister of Crosmichael,
on Loch Ken; Spalding, minister at Parton,
also by Loch Ken; Falconer, minister at Keltown;
Mr. M‘Lellan of Colline, Lennox of Milhouse,
and a number of farmers. These were
all neighbours, and all attested what they saw
and heard. Robert Chambers says, “There
never, perhaps, was any mystic history better
attested. Few narrations of the kind have included
occurrences and appearances which it was
more difficult to reconcile with the theory of trick
or imposture.” Mr. Telfair himself had been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_liii">[liii]</span>
chaplain, in 1687, to Sir Thomas Kirkpatrick
of Closeburn. He was then an Episcopalian.</p>

<p>Andrew Mackie was a stone-mason at Rerrick.
On March 7 (1695?), and for long after, stones
began to fly about in his house by night and
day. “The stones which hit any person had
not half their natural weight.” Mackie complained
to Telfair, his minister, who entered the
house and prayed: nothing odd occurred. As
he stood outside, he “saw two little stones drop
down on the croft;” then he was asked to return,
and was pelted inside the cottage. This was
March 11. For a week there was no more
trouble, then the disturbances began again. Mr.
Telfair was sent for, and was pelted, beaten with
a staff, and heard loud knockings. “That night,
as I was at prayer, leaning on a bedside, I felt
something lifting up my arm. I, casting my
eyes thither, perceived a little white hand and
arm from the elbow down, but presently it
evanished.” “There was never anything seen
except that hand I saw,” and an apparition of
a boy in grey clothes. Sometimes the stoning
went on in the open air.<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> There were plenty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_liv">[liv]</span>
of touchings, grippings, and scratchings. “The
door-bar” (a long, heavy piece of squared wood)
“would go thorow the house as if a person were
carrying it in their hand, yet nothing seen doing
it.” Here we compare, in <cite>Proc. S. P. R.</cite>, February
1892, the story of a carpenter’s shop at
Swanland, in Yorkshire, where pieces of wood
were “levitated” into abnormal flight. No imposture
was discovered, nor was the presence of
any one person necessary.</p>

<p>The ministers of Kells and Crosmichael were
pelted with stones of eight pounds weight. On
April 6, fire-balls floated through the cottage.
When five ministers were present, “it made all
the house shake, brake a hole through the
thatch, and poured in great stones.” “It handled
the legs of some as with a man’s hand;” it
hoisted Mr. Telfair, Lennox of Millhouse, and
others off the ground! A sieve flew through
the house; Mackie caught it; a force gripped
it, and pulled the interior part out of the rim.
A day of humiliation was solemnly kept in the
parish, which only excited the emulation of the
disturbing agent; “it continued in a most fearful
manner without intermission.” Voices were
heard, which talked nonsense of a semi-scriptural<span class="pagenum" id="Page_lv">[lv]</span>
kind; finally the thing died out early in May.
By the way, on April 28, “it pulled down the
end of the house, all the stone-work thereof.”</p>

<p>This is a very odd case, as no suspicion is
thrown on the children. The attestations of
several witnesses are given, not only at the close,
but for almost every separate incident. The
vision of the white hand is agreeable.</p>

<p><cite>The Devil of Glen Luce</cite>, in Galloway, was
published by Sinclair in his <cite>Hydrostaticks</cite>, of all
places, in 1672, and again in <cite>Satan’s Invisible
World</cite>, and by Glanvil in <cite lang="la">Sadducismus Triumphatus</cite>.
In this affair a boy called Thomas, a
son of the unlucky householder, was clearly the
agent. The phenomena were stone-throwing,
beating with sticks, levitation of a plate, and a
great deal of voices, probably uttered by the
aforesaid Thomas. The Synod ordered a day of
humiliation (1655-56).</p>

<p>The affair of the Drummer of Tedworth (1661)
is, or ought to be, too well known for quotation.
The troubles began after Mr. Mompesson seized
the drum of a vagrant musician. In the presence
of a clergyman, chairs walked about the
room of themselves, “a bed-staff was thrown at
the minister, but so favourably that a lock of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_lvi">[lvi]</span>
wool could not have fallen more softly.” The
children, as usual, were especially haunted. A
jingling of money was common, as it also was at
Epworth. Lights wandered about the house,
“blue and glimmering.” The noise was persistent
in the woodwork of the children’s beds,
while their hands were outside. The knocks
answered knocks made by visitors. There were
divers other marvels. The Drummer was suspected,
but, consciously or not, the children
were probably the agents. They seem to have
been in their usual health.<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> In Galashiels (date
not given), loud knocks on the floor accompanied
a hystero-epileptic girl wherever she sat. In
bed, “her body was so lifted up that many
strong men were not able to keep it down.”
The minister, who could make nothing of her,
was Mr. Wilkie; the girl was Margaret Wilson
(Sinclair, p. 200).</p>

<p>This little parcel of strange stories may suffice
to show that part of the Fairy belief is based on
such incidents as still occur, or are reported to
occur, just in the old fashion. It is for psychologists
and physicians to ascertain how far, if at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_lvii">[lvii]</span>
all, the incidents are produced by hysterical, or
epileptic, or somnambulistic patients. Common
forthright trickery is usually detected in paid
mediums. But the trickery simulates real
events, or continues an old traditional form of
imposture. The moral that parents should not
allow their children to be present at <i lang="fr">séances</i>
hardly needs enforcing. Some of them may
escape unharmed, but frightful injuries may be
inflicted on health and on character.<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>


<h3>VI. <span class="smcap">Second Sight and “Telepathy.”</span></h3>

<p>We have already hinted that events of an
ordinary kind—illusions, cases of mistaken identity,
or hallucination—are probably the ground-work
in part of the Highland belief in second
sight. Of course, if a certain proportion of
hallucinations were or could be taken for “veridical,”
attention would be given to these alone:
the others would be neglected. The Psychical
Society has collected and examined hundreds of
these cases in modern life.</p>

<p>The Society may find out, experimentally,
whether second sight can be acquired in the
manner described by Mr. Kirk—whether by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_lviii">[lviii]</span>
the hair tether, or by merely putting the foot
under that of a seer. Thus contact is used
in thought reading, as, in second sight, the
seer by contact communicates his hallucination.
Second sight itself is now called telepathy,
which, however, does not essentially advance
our knowledge of the subject. It is either very
common, or people who choose to claim the
possession of it are very common. In our
society it is mere matter for idle tales; in
the Highlands the second sight was a belief
and a system. Mr. Pepys and Dr. Johnson
investigated the matter, and Dr. Johnson came
away open to conviction, but unconvinced. The
Psychical Society is now examining second
sight in the Highlands. It is interesting to
learn that the Presbyterian seers justified their
visions out of the Bible, which also justified
the burning of these gifted men on occasion.
Mr. Kirk is tolerant enough to ascribe their
visions to a “bounty of Providence.” This
may have passed, north of the Highland
line, but in Fife and the south the seers would
speedily have been accommodated with a stake
and tar-barrel. The writings of Wodrow and
Mr. Robert Blair of St. Andrews (1650-60)<span class="pagenum" id="Page_lix">[lix]</span>
prove that if a savoury preacher wrought marvels,
he was inspired, but if an amateur did
the very same things,—prophesied, healed
diseases, and so forth,—he, or she, was likely
to be haled before the Presbytery, and possibly
dragged to the stake. In the Highlands these
invidious distinctions were less forcibly drawn.
Mr. Kirk treats the whole question in his
curiously cold scientific way. If these things
occur, they are in the realm of Nature, and are
results of causes which may be variously conjectured.
They may be providential, or a sport
of evolution, derived from “a complexionall
Quality of the first acquirer,” which often
becomes hereditary in his lineage.</p>

<p>Lord Tarbott’s letter to an inquirer, Robert
Boyle, is added by Mr. Kirk to his little
treatise, with his own annotations. His belief
that the Fairy sights could only be seen while
the eyes are kept steady without twinkling, is
attested by a well-known anecdote. On the
afternoon of Culloden, a little girl, staying
with Lord Lovat at Gortuleg, was reading in
a window-seat. Chancing to look out, she saw
a company of headlong riders hastening to the
castle. Believing them to be the <em>Sleagh Maith</em>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_lx">[lx]</span>
she tried hard to keep her eyes from twinkling,
that she might not lose the vision. But these,
alas! were no Fairies, they were Prince Charles
and his men flying from the victorious English.
The tale proves that the belief long survived
the day of the minister of Aberfoyle. Lord
Tarbott mentions, also, the vision of the shroud
on the breast of a man about to die, which
seems to be alluded to in the prophecy of
Theoclymenus in the <cite>Odyssey</cite>. Lord Tarbott’s
tales are of the familiar kind, there are dozens
of such in <cite lang="la">Theophilus Insulanus</cite>. Mr. Kirk’s
notes are chiefly remarkable for his citation of
Walter Grahame’s “evil eye,” which killed
what he praised,—a world-wide superstition, too
common to need supporting by foreign and
classical examples.</p>

<p>Unluckily, at this point Mr. Kirk abandons
what we may call his scientific attitude. He
has accounted for his “supernatural” affairs
as not supernatural at all, but phenomena in
Nature, and subject, like other phenomena, to
laws. But now it occurs to him to explain the
conduct of his <em>Sleagh Maith</em> as the result of
missionary zeal on their part: “they endeavour
to convince us of a Deity;” though, on the face<span class="pagenum" id="Page_lxi">[lxi]</span>
of his argument, a Co-walker no more proves a
Deity than does an ordinary “walker.” He may
have been reading “the learned Dr. Mor” (More
the Platonist), and may have altered his ideas.
His account of a girl who learned, or rather
composed, a long poem by aid of “our nimble
and courteous spirits,” affords an early example
of what is called “an inspirational medium.”
It is unlucky that Mr. Kirk did not publish
this work, of which he had a copy. The ordinary
“spiritual” poetry may be written, as Dr.
Johnson said of <cite>Ossian</cite>, “by any one who would
abandon his mind to it.” When Mr. Kirk
maintains that Neolithic arrow-heads could not
have been executed “by all the Airt of man,”
he relapses from his usual odd common-sense.
He also believes in men who are magically shot-proof,
like Claverhouse, who had to be shot by a
silver bullet; like Archbishop Sharp, on whom
his pious assassins erroneously held that their
bullets took no effect; and like certain soldiers
mentioned by Dugald Dalgetty of Drumthwacket.
This absurd belief was very generally held by
the Covenanters. Where his local superstitions
and those of his generation are not concerned,
Mr. Kirk recovers his clearness of intellect. In<span class="pagenum" id="Page_lxii">[lxii]</span>
Purgatory he finds only the pre-Christian Hades,
“our Secret Republick,” with an ecclesiastical
colouring—“additional Fictions of Monks’ doting
and crazied Heads.” Mr. Kirk did not perceive
the danger involved in his own argument. If
a Highland second-sighted man answers to a
Hebrew prophet in his visions and trances, a
Hebrew prophet is in danger of being no more
considered than a Highland second-sighted man.
However, it is to Mr. Kirk’s praise that he shows
no persecuting disposition as far as witches are
concerned (though he has seen them pricked),
and that he argues very fairly from his premisses,
and within his limits.<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> He recognises the unity
of spiritual phenomena and of popular beliefs,
whether it springs from a common well-head of
delusion in our nature, or whether it really has
a source in the observation of peculiar and rather
rare phenomena.</p>

<p>To the Edinburgh edition of 1815 (probably
the only one) the editor added the work of
Theophilus Insulanus on Second Sight. This is
not rare nor expensive, and we do not reproduce
it. One case of “telepathy” may be quoted
from Theophilus.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_lxiii">[lxiii]</span></p>

<p>“Donald Beaton, residenter in Hammir, related
that, in his passage from Glasgow to the
Isle of Sky, he stopped at Tippermory, a known
harbour in the Isle of Mull.” Here some one
gave him a loin of venison. Donald, whose
wife’s mother was a seer, to try her powers,
wished that piece of venison in her hands.
“The same night the seer, who lived with her
daughter, his wife, apprehended she saw him
enter the house with a shapeless lump in his
hands—she knew not what, but it resembled
flesh, which gave herself and her daughter great
joy, as they had despaired of him by his long
absence.” This is “telepathy,” if telepathy
there be.</p>

<p>Another picturesque tale shows how, on the
night before the Rout of Moy, Patrick M‘Caskill
met the famed M‘Rimmon (<em>sic</em>), M‘Leod’s piper,
in the town of Inverness, and saw him contract
into the size of a boy of five or six, and expand
again into his athletic proportions. M‘Rimmon
was killed in the Rout of Moy—an attempt to
surprise and seize Prince Charles. Before leaving
Skye he had prophesied—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indentq">“M‘Leod shall come back,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But M‘Rimmon shall never.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_lxiv">[lxiv]</span></p>

<p>The editor is acquainted with a splendid case
of second sight in Kensington. The seer was
an accomplished English gentleman, and mentioned
his vision at the moment to a witness
who remembers and corroborates the statement.
Thus the Hebrides and Highlands have no
monopoly of second sight.</p>

<p>The researches of M. Charcot, M. Richet, and
other psychologists do not at present help us
much in the matter of veridical second sight.
It is not a hallucination “suggested” to a hypnotised
subject, but an impression produced by
a remote person or event on a subject who has
not been hypnotised at all. For example, Dr.
Adam Clarke, in his <cite>Life</cite> (vol. ii. p. 16) tells us
of Mr. Tracy Clarke, who, being in the Isle of
Man with his son, dreamed that he had visited
his wife in Liverpool. He told his son that
Mrs. Clarke was looking very well, but, contrary
to her habit, was sleeping in the best bedroom.
On the day when Mr. Clarke said this, Mrs.
Clarke, who had been sleeping in her best bedroom,
told the little son who lay in her room
that she had heard his father ride up to the
house, stable his horse, open the door, come
upstairs, and walk round her bed, but that she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_lxv">[lxv]</span>
could not see him. This is a case at least of
second hearing, and has no hypnotic explanation.</p>

<p>We end in the candid spirit of Dr. Johnson,
as far as the Polter-Geist and second sight are
concerned—willing to be convinced, but far indeed
from conviction. As to the Fairy belief, we
conceive it to be a complex matter, from which
tradition, with its memory of earth-dwellers, is
not wholly absent, while more is due to a survival
of the pre-Christian Hades, and to the belief
in local spirits—the Vuis of Melanesia, the
Nereids of ancient and modern Greece, the Lares
of Rome, the fateful Mœræ and Hathors—old
imaginings of a world not yet “dispeopled of its
dreams.”<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

<p class="drop-cap">These <em>Siths</em>, or <span class="smcap">Fairies</span>, they call
<em>Sleagh Maith</em>, or the Good
People, it would seem, to prevent
the Dint of their ill Attempts,
(for the Irish use to bless all they fear Harme
of;) and are said to be of a midle Nature
betuixt Man and Angel, as were Dæmons
thought to be of old; of intelligent studious
Spirits, and light changable Bodies, (lyke those
called Astral,) somewhat of the Nature of a condensed
Cloud, and best seen in Twilight. Thes
Bodies be so plyable thorough the Subtilty of the
Spirits that agitate them, that they can make
them appear or disappear att Pleasure. Some
have Bodies or Vehicles so spungious, thin, and
defecat, that they are fed by only sucking into
some fine spirituous Liquors, that peirce lyke<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
pure Air and Oyl: others feid more gross on
the Foyson or substance of Corns and Liquors,
or Corne it selfe that grows on the Surface of
the Earth, which these Fairies steall away, partly
invisible, partly preying on the Grain, as do
Crowes and Mice; wherefore in this same Age,
they are some times heard to bake Bread, strike
Hammers, and do such lyke Services within the
little Hillocks they most haunt: some whereof
of old, before the Gospell dispelled Paganism,
and in some barbarous Places as yet, enter
Houses after all are at rest, and set the Kitchens
in order, cleansing all the Vessels. Such Drags
goe under the name of Brownies. When we
have plenty, they have Scarcity at their Homes;
and on the contrarie (for they are empowred to
catch as much Prey everywhere as they please,)
there Robberies notwithstanding oft tymes occassion
great Rickes of Corne not to bleed so
weill, (as they call it,) or prove so copious by
verie farr as wes expected by the Owner.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">There</span> Bodies of congealled Air are some
tymes caried aloft, other whiles grovell in different
Schapes, and enter into any Cranie or Clift<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>
of the Earth where Air enters, to their ordinary
Dwellings; the Earth being full of Cavities and
Cells, and there being no Place nor Creature
but is supposed to have other Animals (greater
or lesser) living in or upon it as Inhabitants;
and no such thing as a pure Wilderness in the
whole Universe.</p>

<p>2. <span class="smcap">We</span> then (the more terrestriall kind have
now so numerously planted all Countreys,) do
labour for that abstruse People, as weill as for
ourselves. Albeit, when severall Countreys were
unhabitated <ins id="tn-7" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'by ws'">
by us</ins>, these had their easy Tillage
above Ground, as we now. The Print of those
Furrous do yet remaine to be seen on the Shoulders
of very high Hills, which was done when
the champayn Ground was Wood and Forrest.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">They</span> remove to other Lodgings at the Beginning
of each Quarter of the Year, so traversing
till Doomsday, being imputent and [impotent
of?] staying in one Place, and finding some Ease
by so purning [Journeying] and changing Habitations.
Their chamælion-lyke Bodies swim in
the Air near the Earth with Bag and Bagadge;
and at such revolution of Time, <span class="smcap">Seers</span>, or Men<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
of the <span class="smcap">Second Sight</span>, (Fæmales being seldome
so qualified) have very terrifying Encounters
with them, even on High Ways; who therefoir
uswally shune to travell abroad at these four
Seasons of the Year, and thereby have made it
a Custome to this Day among the Scottish-Irish
to keep Church duely evry first Sunday of the
Quarter to sene or hallow themselves, their
Corns and Cattell, from the Shots and Stealth
of these wandring Tribes; and many of these
superstitious People will not be seen in Church
againe till the nixt Quarter begin, as if no Duty
were to be learned or done by them, but all the
Use of Worship and Sermons were to save them
from these Arrows that fly in the Dark.<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">They</span> are distributed in Tribes and Orders,
and have Children, Nurses, Mariages, Deaths,
and Burialls, in appearance, even as we, (unless
they so do for a Mock-show, or to prognosticate
some such Things among us.)</p>

<p>3. <span class="smcap">They</span> are clearly seen by these Men of the
<span class="smcap">Second Sight</span> to eat at Funeralls [and] Banquets;
hence many of the Scottish-Irish will not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
teast Meat at these Meittings, lest they have
Communion with, or be poysoned by, them.
So are they seen to carrie the Beer or Coffin
with the Corps among the midle-earth Men to
the Grave. Some Men of that exalted Sight
(whither by Art or Nature) have told me they
have seen at these Meittings a Doubleman, or
the Shape of some Man in two places; that is,
a superterranean and a subterranean Inhabitant,
perfectly resembling one another in all Points,
whom he notwithstanding could easily distinguish
one from another, by some secret Tockens and
Operations, and so go speak to the Man his
Neighbour and Familiar, passing by the Apparition
or Resemblance of him. They avouch that
every Element and different State of Being have
Animals resembling these of another Element;
as there be Fishes sometimes at Sea resembling
Monks of late Order in all their Hoods and
Dresses; so as the Roman invention of good and
bad Dæmons, and guardian Angells particularly
assigned, is called by them an ignorant Mistake,
sprung only from this Originall. They call this
Reflex-man a Co-walker, every way like the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
Man, as a Twin-brother and Companion, haunting
him as his shadow, as is oft seen and known
among Men (resembling the Originall,) both
before and after the Originall is dead; and wes
also often seen of old to enter a Hous, by which
the People knew that the Person of that Liknes
wes to Visite them within a few days. This
Copy, Echo, or living Picture, goes att last to his
own Herd. It accompanied that Person so long
and frequently for Ends best known to it selfe,
whither to guard him from the secret Assaults of
some of its own Folks, or only as ane sportfull
Ape to counterfeit all his Actions. However,
the Stories of old <span class="smcap">Witches</span> prove beyond contradiction,
that all Sorts of People, Spirits which
assume light aery Bodies, or crazed Bodies co-acted
by forrein Spirits, seem to have some
Pleasure, (at least to asswage from Pain or
Melancholy,) by frisking and capering like
Satyrs, or whistling and screeching (like unlukie
Birds) in their unhallowed Synagogues
and Sabboths. If invited and earnestly required,
these Companions make themselves
knowne and familiar to Men; other wise, being<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
in a different State and Element, they nather
can nor will easily converse with them. They
avouch that a Heluo, or Great-eater, hath a
voracious Elve to be his attender, called a
Joint-eater or Just-halver, feeding on the Pith
or Quintessence of what the Man eats; and that
therefoir he continues Lean like a Hawke or
Heron, notwith standing his devouring Appetite:
yet it would seem that they convey that
substance elsewhere, for these Subterraneans eat
but little in their Dwellings; there Food being
exactly clean, and served up by Pleasant Children,
lyke inchanted Puppets. What Food they
extract from us is conveyed to their Homes by
secret Paths, as sume skilfull Women do the Pith
and Milk from their Neighbours Cows into their
own Chiese-hold thorow a Hair-tedder, at a great
Distance, by Airt Magic, or by drawing a spickot
fastened to a Post, which will bring milk as farr
of as a Bull will be heard to roar.<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> The Chiese
made of the remaineing Milk of a Cow thus
strain’d will swim in Water like a Cork. The
Method they take to recover their Milk is a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
bitter chyding of the suspected Inchanters,
charging them by a counter Charme to give
them back their own, in God, or their Master’s
Name. But a little of the Mother’s Dung
stroakit on the Calves Mouth before it suck
any, does prevent this theft.</p>

<p>4. <span class="smcap">Their</span> Houses are called large and fair,
and (unless att some odd occasions) unperceaveable
by vulgar eyes, like Rachland, and other
inchanted Islands, having fir Lights, continual
Lamps, and Fires, often seen without Fuel to
sustain them. Women are yet alive who tell
they were taken away when in Child-bed to
nurse Fairie Children, a lingering voracious
Image of their (them?) being left in their place,
(like their Reflexion in a Mirrour,) which (as if
it were some insatiable Spirit in ane assumed
Bodie) made first semblance to devour the
Meats that it cunningly carried by, and then
left the Carcase as if it expired and departed
thence by a naturall and common Death. The
Child, and Fire, with Food and other Necessaries,
are set before the Nurse how soon she
enters; but she nather perceaves any Passage<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
out, nor sees what those People doe in other
Rooms of the Lodging. When the Child is
wained, the Nurse dies, or is conveyed back,
or gets it to her choice to stay there. But if
any Superterraneans be so subtile, as to practice
Slights for procuring a Privacy to any of their
Misteries, (such as making use of their Oyntments,
which as Gyges’s Ring makes them invisible,
or nimble, or casts them in a Trance,
or alters their Shape, or makes Things appear
at a vast Distance, &amp;c.) they smite them without
Paine, as with a Puff of Wind, and bereave them
of both the naturall and acquired Sights in the
twinkling of ane Eye, (both these Sights, where
once they come, being in the same Organ and
inseparable,) or they strick them Dumb. The
Tramontains to this Day put Bread, the Bible,
or a piece of Iron, in Womens Beds when
travelling, to save them from being thus stollen;
and they commonly report, that all uncouth, unknown
Wights are terrifyed by nothing earthly
so much as by cold Iron. They delyver the
Reason to be that Hell lying betwixt the chill
Tempests, and the Fire Brands of scalding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
Metals, and Iron of the North, (hence the
Loadstone causes a tendency to that Point,)
by ane Antipathy thereto, these odious far-scenting
Creatures shrug and fright at all that
comes thence relating to so abhorred a Place,
whence their Torment is eather begun, or
feared to come hereafter.</p>

<p>5. <span class="smcap">Their</span> Apparell and Speech is like that
of the People and Countrey under which they
live: so are they seen to wear Plaids and variegated
Garments in the Highlands of Scotland,
and Suanochs therefore in Ireland. They speak
but litle, and that by way of whistling, clear,
not rough. The verie Divels conjured in any
Countrey, do answer in the Language of the
Place; yet sometimes the Subterraneans speak
more distinctly than at other times. Ther
Women are said to Spine very fine, to Dy,
to Tossue, and Embroyder: but whither it is
as manuall Operation of substantiall refined
Stuffs, with apt and solid Instruments, or only
curious Cob-webs, impalpable Rainbows, and
a fantastic Imitation of the Actions of more
terrestricall Mortalls, since it transcended all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
the Senses of the Seere to discerne whither, I
leave to conjecture as I found it.</p>

<p>6. <span class="smcap">There</span> Men travell much abroad, either
presaging or aping the dismall and tragicall
Actions of some amongst us; and have also many
disastorous Doings of their own, as Convocations,
Fighting, Gashes, Wounds, and Burialls,
both in the Earth and Air. They live much
longer than wee; yet die at last, or [at] least
vanish from that State. ’Tis ane of their Tenets,
that nothing perisheth, but (as the Sun and
Year) every Thing goes in a Circle, lesser or
greater, and is renewed and refreshed in its
Revolutions; as ’tis another, that every Bodie
in the Creation moves, (which is a sort of Life;)
and that nothing moves, but [h]as another
Animal moving on it; and so on, to the utmost
minutest Corpuscle that’s capable to be a Receptacle
of Life.</p>

<p>7. <span class="smcap">They</span> are said to have aristocraticall Rulers
and Laws, but no discernible Religion, Love,
or Devotion towards God, the blessed Maker
of all: they disappear whenever they hear his
Name invocked, or the Name of <span class="smcap">Jesus</span>, (at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
which all do bow willinglie, or by constraint,
that dwell above or beneath within the Earth,
Philip. 2. 10;) nor can they act ought at that
Time after hearing of that sacred Name. The
<span class="smcap">Tabhaisver</span>, or Seer, that corresponds with
this kind of Familiars, can bring them with a
Spel to appear to himselfe or others when he
pleases, as readily as Endor Witch to those of
her Kind. He tells, they are ever readiest to
go on hurtfull Errands, but seldome will be the
Messengers of great Good to Men. He is not
terrified with their Sight when he calls them,
but seeing them in a surpryze (as often he does)
frights him extreamly. And glaid would he be
quite of such, for the hideous Spectacles seen
among them; as the torturing of some Wight,
earnest ghostly stairing Looks, Skirmishes, and
the like. They do not all the Harme which
appearingly they have Power to do; nor are
they perceaved to be in great Pain, save that
they are usewally silent and sullen. They are
said to have many pleasant toyish Books; but
the operation of these Peices only appears in
some Paroxisms of antic corybantic Jolity, as if<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
ravisht and prompted by a new Spirit entering
into them at that Instant, lighter and mirrier
than their own. Other Books they have of
involved abstruse Sense, much like the Rosurcian
[Rosycrucian] Style. They have nothing of the
Bible, save collected Parcells for Charms and
counter Charms; not to defend themselves
withall, but to operate on other Animals, for
they are a People invulnerable by our Weapons;
and albeit Were-wolves and Witches true Bodies
are (by the union of the Spirit of Nature that
runs thorow all, echoing and doubling the Blow
towards another) wounded at Home, when the
astrial assumed Bodies are stricken elsewhere;
as the Strings of a Second Harp, tune to ane
unison, Sounds, though only ane be struck;
yet these People have not a second, or so gross
a Bodie at all, to be so pierced; but as Air,
which when divyded units againe; or if they
feel Pain by a Blow, they are better Physicians
than wee, and quickly cure it. They are not
subject to sore Sicknesses, but dwindle and
decay at a certain Period, all about ane Age.
Some say their continual Sadness is because of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
their pendulous State, (like those Men, Luc. 13.
2. 6.) as uncertain what at the last Revolution
will become of them, when they are lock’t up
into ane unchangeable Condition; and if they
have any frolic Fitts of Mirth, ’tis as the constrained
grinning of a Mort-head, or rather as
acted on a Stage, and moved by another, ther
[than?] cordially comeing of themselves. But
other Men of the Second Sight, being illiterate,
and unwary in their Observations, learn from
those; one averring those subterranean People
to be departed Souls, attending awhile in this
inferior State, and clothed with Bodies procured
throwgh their Almsdeeds in this Lyfe; fluid,
active, ætheriall Vehicles to hold them, that
they may not scatter, or wander, and be lost in
the Totum, or their first Nothing; but if any
were so impious as to have given no Alms, they
say when the Souls of such do depairt, they
sleep in an <ins id="tn-18" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'unaictve State'">
unactive State</ins> till they resume the
terrestriall Bodies again: others, that what the
Low-countrey Scotts calls a Wreath, and the
Irish <span class="smcap">Taibhshe</span><a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> or Death’s Messenger, (appearing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
sometimes as a little rough Dog, and if
crossed and conjured in Time, will be pacified
by the Death of any other Creature instead of
the sick Man,) is only exuvious Fumes of the
Man approaching Death, exhal’d and congeal’d
into a various Likness,<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> (as Ships and Armies are
sometimes shapt in the Air,) and called astral
Bodies, agitated as Wild-fire with Wind, and are
neather Souls or counterfeiting Spirits; yet not
a few avouch (as is said,) that surelie these are a
numerous People by them selves, having their
own Polities. Which Diversities of Judgments
may occasion severall Inconsonancies in this Rehearsall,
after the narrowest Scrutiny made about it.</p>

<p>8. <span class="smcap">Their</span> Weapons are most what solid earthly
Bodies, nothing of Iron, but much of Stone,
like to yellow soft Flint Spa, shaped like a
barbed Arrow-head, but flung like a Dairt, with
great Force. These Armes (cut by Airt and
Tools it seems beyond humane) have something
of the Nature of Thunderbolt subtilty, and mortally
wounding the vital Parts without breaking
the Skin; of which Wounds I have observed in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
Beasts, and felt them with my Hands. They
are not as infallible Benjamites, hitting at a
Hair’s-breadth; nor are they wholly unvanquishable,
at least in Appearance.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Men</span> of that <span class="smcap">Second Sight</span> do not discover
strange Things when asked, but at Fits
and Raptures, as if inspyred with some Genius
at that Instant, which before did lurk in or
about them. Thus I have frequently spoke to
one of them, who in his Transport told he cut
the Bodie of one of those People in two with
his Iron Weapon, and so escaped this Onset,
yet he saw nothing left behind of that appearing
divyded; at other Times he out wrested
[wrestled?] some of them. His Neibours often
perceaved this Man to disappear at a certane
Place, and about one Hour after to become
visible, and discover him selfe near a Bow-shot
from the first Place. It was in that Place where
he became invisible, said he, that the Subterraneans
did encounter and combate with him.
Those who are unseened or unsanctified (called
Fey) are said to be pierced or wounded with
those People’s Weapons, which makes them do<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
somewhat verie unlike their former Practice,
causing a sudden Alteration, yet the Cause
thereof unperceavable at present; nor have
they Power (either they cannot make use of
their natural Powers, or ask’t not the heavenly
Aid,) to escape the Blow impendent. A Man
of the Second Sight perceaved a Person standing
by him (sound to others view) wholly gored
in Blood, and he (amazed-like) bid him instantly
flee. The whole Man laught at his Airt and
Warning, since there was no appearance of
Danger. He had scarce contracted his Lips
from Laughter, when unexpectedly his Enemy
leapt in at his Side, and stab’d him with their
Weapons. They also pierce Cows or other
Animals, usewally said to be Elf-shot, whose
purest Substance (if they die) these Subterraneans
take to live on, viz. the aereal and
ætherial Parts, the most spirituous Matter for
prolonging of Life, such as Aquavitæ (moderately
taken) is among Liquors, leaving the terrestrial
behind. The Cure of such Hurts is,
only for a Man to find out the Hole with his
Finger; as if the Spirits flowing from a Man’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
warme Hand were Antidote sufficient against
their poyson’d Dairts.</p>

<p>9. <span class="smcap">As</span> Birds and Beasts, whose Bodies are
much used to the Change of the frie and open
Air, forsee Storms; so those invisible People
are more sagacious to understand by the Books
of Nature Things to come, than wee, who are
pestered with the grosser Dregs of all elementary
Mixtures, and have our purer Spirits choaked
by them. The Deer scents out a Man and
Powder (tho a late Invention) at a great Distance;
a hungry Hunter, Bread; and the Raven,
a Carrion: Ther Brains, being long clarified by
the high and subtil Air, will observe a very small
Change in a Trice. Thus a Man of the Second
Sight, perceaving the Operations of these forecasting
invisible People among us, (indulged
thorow a stupendious Providence to give Warnings
of some remarkable Events, either in the
Air, Earth, or Waters,) told he saw a Winding-shroud
creeping on a walking healthful Persons
Legs till it come to the Knee; and afterwards
it came up to the Midle, then to the Shoulders,
and at last over the Head, which was visible to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
no other Persone. And by observing the Spaces
of Time betwixt the severall Stages, he easily
guessed how long the Man was to live who wore
the Shroud; for when it approached his Head,
he told that such a Person was ripe for the Grave.</p>

<p>10. <span class="smcap">There</span> be many Places called Fairie-hills,
which the Mountain People think impious
and dangerous to peel or discover, by taking
Earth or Wood from them; superstitiously beleiving
the Souls of their Predicessors to dwell
there.<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> And for that End (say they) a Mote or
Mount was dedicate beside every Church-yard,
to receive the Souls till their adjacent Bodies
arise, and so become as a Fairie-hill; they useing
Bodies of Air when called Abroad. They
also affirme those Creatures that move invisibly
in a House, and cast hug great Stones, but do
no much Hurt, because counter-wrought by
some more courteous and charitable Spirits that
are everywhere ready to defend Men, (Dan. 10.
13.) to be Souls that have not attained their
Rest, thorough a vehement Desire of revealling
a Murther or notable Injurie done or receaved,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
or a Treasure that was forgot in their Liftyme
on Earth, which when disclos’d to a Conjurer
alone, the Ghost quite removes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the nixt Country to that of my former
Residence, about the Year 1676, when there
was some Scarcity of Graine, a marvelous Illapse
and Vision strongly struck the Imagination of
two Women in one Night, living at a good
Distance from one another, about a Treasure
hid in a Hill, called <span class="smcap">Sithbhruaich</span>, or Fayrie-hill.
The Appearance of a Treasure was first
represented to the Fancy, and then an audible
Voyce named the Place where it was to their
awaking Senses. Whereupon both arose, and
meitting accidentallie at the Place, discovered
their Designe; and joyntly digging, found a
Vessell as large as a Scottish Peck, full of small
Pieces of good Money, of ancient Coyn; which
halving betuixt them, they sold in Dish-fulls for
Dish-fulls of Meall to the Countrey People.
Very many of undoubted Credit saw, and had
of the Coyn to this Day. But whither it was a
good or bad Angell, one of the subterranean
People, or the restless Soul of him who hid it,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
that discovered it, and to what End it was done,
I leave to the Examination of others.</p>

<p>11. <span class="smcap">These</span> Subterraneans have Controversies,
Doubts, Disputs, Feuds, and Siding of Parties;
there being some Ignorance in all Creatures,
and the vastest created Intelligences not compassing
all Things. As to Vice and Sin, whatever
their own Laws be, sure, according to ours,
and Equity, natural, civil, and reveal’d, they
transgress and commit Acts of Injustice, and
Sin, by what is above said, as to their stealling
of Nurses to their Children, and that other sort
of Plaginism in catching our Children away,
(may seem to heir some Estate in those invisible
Dominions,) which never returne. For the
Inconvenience of their Succubi, who tryst with
Men, it is abominable; but for Swearing and
Intemperance, they are not observed so subject
to those Irregularities, as to Envy, Spite, Hypocracie,
Lieing, and Dissimulation.</p>

<p>12. <span class="smcap">As</span> our Religion oblidges us not to make
a peremptory and curious Search into these
Obstrusenesses, so that the Histories of all Ages
give as many plain Examples of extraordinary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
Occurrances as make a modest Inquiry not contemptable.
How much is written of Pigme’s,
Fairies, Nymphs, Syrens, Apparitions, which tho
not the tenth Part true, yet could not spring
of nothing! Even English Authors relate (of)
Barry Island, in Glamorganshire, that laying
your Ear into a Clift of the Rocks, blowing
of Bellows, stricking of Hammers, clashing of
Armour, fyling of Iron, will be heard distinctly
ever since Merlin inchaunted those subterranean
Wights to a solid manuall forging of Arm’s to
Aurelius Ambrosius and his Brittans, till he
returned; which Merlin being killed in a Battell,
and not coming to loose the Knot, these active
Vulcans are there ty’d to a perpetuall Labour.
But to dip no deeper into this Well, I will nixt
give some Account how the Seer my Informer
comes to have this secret Way of Correspondence
beyond other Mortalls.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">There</span> be odd Solemnities at investing a
Man with the Priviledges of the whole Mistery
of this Second Sight. He must run a Tedder
of Hair (which bound a Corps to the Bier) in a
Helix [?] about his Midle, from End to End;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
then bow his Head downwards, as did Elijah,
1 Kings, 18, 42. and look back thorough his
Legs untill he sie a Funerall advance till the
People cross two Marches; or look thus back
thorough a Hole where was a Knot of Fir.
But if the Wind change Points while the Hair
Tedder is ty’d about him, he is in Peril of his
Lyfe. The usewall Method for a curious Person
to get a transient Sight of this otherwise invisible
Crew of Subterraneans, (if impotently and over
rashly sought,) is to put his [left Foot under the
Wizard’s right] Foot, and the Seer’s Hand is
put on the Inquirer’s Head, who is to look
over the Wizard’s right Shoulder, (which hes
ane ill Appearance, as if by this Ceremony ane
implicit Surrender were made of all betwixt
the Wizard’s Foot and his Hand, ere the Person
can be admitted a privado to the Airt;) then
will he see a Multitude of Wight’s, like furious
hardie Men, flocking to him haistily from all
Quarters, as thick as Atoms in the Air; which
are no Nonentities or Phantasms, Creatures
proceiding from ane affrighted Apprehensione,
confused or crazed Sense, but Realities, appearing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
to a stable Man in his awaking Sense, and
enduring a rationall Tryall of their Being. Thes
thorow Fear strick him breathless and speechless.
The Wizard, defending the Lawfullness of his
Skill, forbids such Horror, and comforts his
Novice by telling of Zacharias, as being struck
speechless at seeing Apparitions, Luke, 1. 20.
Then he further maintains his Airt, by vouching
Elisha to have had the same, and disclos’d it
thus unto his Servant in 2 Kings, 6. 17. when
he blinded the Syrians; and Peter in Act, 5. 9.
forseing the Death of Saphira, by perceaving as
it were her Winding-sheet about her before
hand; and Paul, in 2nd Corinth. 12. 4. who
got such a Vision and Sight as should not, nor
could be told. Elisha also in his Chamber saw
Gehazi his Servant, at a great Distance, taking
a reward from Naaman, 2d Kings, 5. 26.
Hence were the Prophets frequently called
<span class="smcap">Seers</span>, or Men of a 2d or more exhalted Sight
than others. He acts for his Purpose also
Math. 4. 8. where the Devil undertakes to give
even Jesus a Sight of all Nations, and the finest
Things in the World, at one Glance, tho in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
their naturall Situations and Stations at a vast
Distance from other. And ’tis said expresly he
did let sie them; not in a Map it seems, nor
by a phantastick magicall jugling of the Sight,
which he could not impose upon so discovering
a Person. It would appear then to have been
a Sight of real solid Substances, and Things of
worth, which he intended as a Bait for his
Purpose. Whence it might seem, (compairing
this Relation of Math. 4. 8. with the former,)
that the extraordinary or Second Sight can be
given by the Ministery of bad as weill as good
Spirits to those that will embrace it. And the
Instance of Balaam and the Pytheniss make
it nothing the less probable. Thus also the
Seer trains his Scholler, by telling of the Gradations
of Nature, ordered by a wise Provydence;
that as the Sight of Bats and Owls transcend
that of Shrews and Moles, so the visive Faculties
of Men are clearer than those of Owls; as
Eagles, Lynxs, and Cats are brighter than Mens.
And again, that Men of the Second Sight
(being designed to give warnings against secret
Engyns) surpass the ordinary Vision of other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
Men, which is a native Habit in some, descended
from their Ancestors, and acquired as ane artificiall
Improvement of their natural Sight in
others; resembling in their own Kynd the
usuall artificiall Helps of optic Glasses, (as Prospectives,
Telescopes, and Microscopes,) without
which ascititious Aids those Men here treated
of do perceive Things that, for their Smallness,
or Subtility, and Secrecy, are invisible to others,
tho dayly conversant with them; they having
such a Beam continuallie about them as that
of the Sun, which when it shines clear only,
lets common Eyes see the Atomes, in the Air,
that without those Rayes they could not discern;
for some have this Second Sight transmitted
from Father to Sone thorow the whole Family,
without their own Consent or others teaching,
proceeding only from a Bounty of Providence
it seems, or by Compact, or by a complexionall
Quality of the first Acquirer. As it may seem
alike strange (yet nothing vicious) in such as
Master Great-rake,<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> the Irish Stroaker, Seventh-sons,
and others that cure the King’s Evill,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
and chase away Deseases and Pains, with only
stroaking of the affected Pairt; which (if it be
not the Reliques of miraculous Operations, or
some secret Virtue in the Womb, of the Parent,
which increaseth until Seventh-sons be borne,
and decreaseth by the same Degrees afterwards,)
proceids only from the sanitive Balsome
of their healthfull Constitutions; Virtue
going out from them by spirituous Effluxes unto
the Patient, and their vigorous healthy Spirits
affecting the sick as usewally the unhealthy
Fumes of the sick infect the sound and whole.</p>

<p>13. <span class="smcap">The</span> Minor Sort of Seers prognosticat
many future Events, only for a Month’s Space,
from the Shoulder-bone of a Sheep on which
a Knife never came, (for as before is said, and
the Nazarits of old had something of it) Iron
hinders all the Opperations of those that travell
in the Intrigues of these hidden Dominions.
By looking into the Bone, they will tell if
Whoredom be committed in the Owner’s House;
what Money the Master of the Sheep had; if
any will die out of that House for that Moneth;
and if any Cattell there will take a Trake, as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
if Planet-struck. Then will they prescribe a
Preservative and Prevention.</p>

<p>14. <span class="smcap">A Woman</span> (it seems ane Exception from
the generall Rule,) singularlie wise in these
Matters of Foirsight, living in Colasnach, ane
Isle of the Hebrides, (in the Time of the Marquess
of Montrose his Wars with the States in
Scotland,) being notorious among many; and
so examined by some that violently seazed that
Isle, if she saw them coming or not? She said,
she saw them coming many Hours before they
came in View of the Isle. But earnestly looking,
she some times took them for Enemyes,
sometime for Friends; and morover they look’t
as if they went from the Isle, not as Men approaching
it, which made her not put the Inhabitants
on their Guard. The Matter was,
that the Barge wherein the Enemie sailed, was
a little befoir taken from the Inhabitants of
that same Isle, and the Men had their Backs
towards the Isle, when they were plying the
oares towards it. Thus this old Scout and
Delphian Oracle was at least deceived, and did
deceave. Being asked who gave her such Sights<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
and Warnings, she said, that as soon as she set
three Crosses of Straw upon the Palm of her
Hand, a great ugly Beast sprang out of the
Earth neer her, and flew in the Air. If what
she enquired had Success according to her
Wish, the Beast would descend calmly, and lick
up the Crosses. If it would not succeid, the
Beast would furiously thrust her and the Crosses
over on the Ground, and so vanish to his
Place.</p>

<p>15. <span class="smcap">Among</span> other Instances of undoubted
Verity, proving in these the Being of such
aerial People, or Species of Creatures not vulgarly
known, I add the subsequent Relations,
some whereof I have from my Acquaintance
with the Actors and Patients, and the Rest
from the Eye-witnesses to the Matter of Fact.
The first whereof shall be of the Woman taken
out of her Child-bed, and having a lingring
Image of her substituted Bodie in her Roome,
which Resemblance decay’d, dy’d, and was
bur’d. But the Person stollen returning to her
Husband after two Years Space, he being convinced
by many undenyable Tokens that she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
was his former Wyfe, admitted her Home, and
had diverse Children by her. Among other
Reports she gave her Husband, this was one:
That she perceived litle what they did in the
spacious House she lodg’d in, untill she anointed
one of her Eyes with a certain Unction that
was by her; which they perceaving to have
acqainted her with their Actions, they fain’d
her blind of that Eye with a Puff of their
Breath. She found the Place full of Light,
without any Fountain or Lamp from whence
it did spring. This Person lived in the Countrey
nixt to that of my last Residence, and
might furnish Matter of Dispute amongst Casuists,
whither if her Husband had been mary’d in the
Interim of her two Years Absence, he was
oblidged to divorse from the second Spouse at
the Return of the first. There is ane Airt,
appearingly without Superstition, for recovering
of such as are stolen, but think it superfluous
to insert it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I saw</span> a Woman of fourtie Years of Age,
and examined her (having another Clergie Man
in my Companie) about a Report that past of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
her long fasting [<em>her Name is not intyre</em>.]<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> It
was told by them of the House, as well as her
selfe, that she tooke verie little or no Food
for severall Years past; that she tarried in the
Fields over Night, saw and conversed with a
People she knew not, having wandered in seeking
of her Sheep, and sleep’t upon a Hillock,
and finding her self transported to another Place
before Day. The Woman had a Child since
that Time, and is still prettie melanchollyous
and silent, hardly ever seen to laugh. Her
natural Heat and radical Moisture seem to be
equally balanced, lyke ane unextinguished Lamp,
and going in a Circle, not unlike to the faint
Lyfe of Bees, and some Sort of Birds, that sleep
all the Winter over, and revive in the Spring.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is usuall in all magicall Airts to have the
Candidates prepossessit with a Believe of their
Tutor’s Skill, and Ability to perform their Feats,
and act their jugling Pranks and Legerdemain;
but a Person called Stewart, possessed with a
prejudice at that was spoken of the 2d Sight,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
and living near to my House, was soe put to it
by a Seer, before many Witnesses, that he lost
his Speech and Power of his Legs, and breathing
excessively, as if expyring, because of the
many fearfull Wights that appeared to him.
The Companie were forced to carrie him into
the House.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is notoriously known what in Killin, within
Perthshire, fell tragically out with a Yeoman
that liv’d hard by, who coming into a Companie
within ane Ale-house, where a Seer sat at Table,
that at the Sight of the Intrant Neighbour, the
Seer starting, rose to go out of the Hous; and
being asked the Reason of his hast, told that
the intrant Man should die within two Days;
at which News the named Intrant stabb’d the
Seer, and was himself executed two Days after
for the Fact.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A Minister</span>, verie intelligent, but misbelieving
all such Sights as were not ordinar, chanceing
to be in a narrow Lane with a Seer, who
perceaving a Wight of a known Visage furioslie
to encounter them, the Seer desired the Minister
to turn out of the Way; who scorning his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
Reason, and holding him selfe in the Path with
them, when the Seer was going hastily out of
the Way, they were both violently cast a side to
a good Distance, and the Fall made them lame
for all their Lyfe. A little after the Minister
was carried Home, one came to tol the Bell
for the Death of the Man whose Representation
met them in the narrow Path some Halfe ane
Hour before.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Another</span> Example is: A Seer in Kintyre, in
Scotland, sitting at Table with diverse others,
suddenly did cast his Head aside. The Companie
asking him why he did it, he answered,
that such a Friend of his, by Name, then in
Ireland, threatened immediately to cast a Dish-full
of Butter in his Face. The Men wrote
down the Day and Hour, and sent to the
Gentleman to know the Truth; which Deed
the Gentleman declared he did at that verie
Time, for he knew that his Friend was a Seer,
and would make sport with it. The Men that
were present, and examined the Matter exactly,
told me this Story; and with all, that a Seer
would with all his Opticks perceive no other
Object so readily as this, at such a Distance.</p>

<p class="p1 negin2">[I thought fit to adjoyne [it] hereunto, that I
might not be thought singular in this Disquisition;
that the Mater of Fact might
be undenyably made out; and that I
might, with all Submission, give Annotations,
with Animadversions, on his supposed
Causes of that Phenomenon, with my
Reasons of Dissent from his Judgement.]</p>


<p class="p1 smcap pad2">Sir,</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I heard</span> very much, but beleived very little,
of the Second Sight; yet its being assumed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
by severall of great Veracity, I was induced
to make Inquirie after it in the Year 1652,
being then confin’d to abide in the North of
Scotland by the English Usurpers. The more
generall Accounts of it were, that many Highlanders,
yet far more Islanders, were qualified
with this Second Sight; that Men, Women,
and Children, indistinctly, were subject to it,
and Children, where Parents were not. Some
times People came to age, who had it not
when young, nor could any tell by what
Means produced. It is a Trouble to most of
them who are subject to it, and they would
be rid of it any Rate if they could. The
Sight is of no long Duration, only continuing
so long as they can keep their Eyes steady
without twinkling. The hardy therefore fix
their look, that they may see the longer; but
the timorous see only Glances, their Eyes always
twinkles at the first Sight of the Object.
That which generally is seen by them, are the
Species of living Creatures, and of inanimate
Things, which was in Motion, such as Ships,
and Habits upon Persons. They, never sie<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
the Species of any Person who is already
dead. What they foirsie fails not to exist in
the Mode, and in that Place where it appears
to them. They cannot well know what Space
of Time shall interveen between the Apparition
and the real Existance: But some of the
hardiest and longest Experience have some
Rules for Conjectures; as, if they sie a Man
with a shrowding Sheet in the Apparition, they
will conjecture at the Nearness or Remoteness
of his Death by the more or less of his Bodie
that is covered by it. They will ordinarily sie
their absent Friends, tho at a great Distance,
some tymes no less than from America to
Scotland, sitting, standing, or walking in some
certain Place; and then they conclude with a
Assurance that they will sie them so and there.
If a Man be in love with a Woman, they will
ordinarily sie the Species of that Man standing
by her, and so likewise if a Woman be in love;
and they conjecture at their Enjoyments (of
each other) by the Species touching (of) the
Person, or appearing at a Distance from her
(if they enjoy not one another.) If they sie<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
the Species of any Person who is sick to die,
they sie them covered over with the shrowding
Sheet.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">These</span> Generalls I had verified to me by
such of them as did sie, and were esteemed
honest and sober by all the Neighbourhood;
for I inquired after such for my Information.
And because there were more of these Seers
in the Isles of Lewis, Harris, and Uist, than
in any other Place, I did entreat Sir James
M‘Donald (who is now dead) Sir Normand
M‘Loud, and Mr. Daniel Morison, a verie
honest Person, (who are still alive,) to make
Inquirie in this uncouth Sight, and to acquaint
me therewith; which they did, and all found
ane Agriement in these Generalls, and informed
me of many Instances confirming what they
said. But though Men of Discretion and
Honour, being but at 2d Hand, I will choose
rather to put myself than my Friends on the
Hazard of being laughed at for incredible
Relations.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I was</span> once travelling in the Highlands, and
a good Number of Servants with me, as is usuall<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
there; and one of them going a little before
me, entering into a House where I was to stay
all Night, and going haistily to the Door, he
suddenly stept back with a Screech, and did
fall by a Stone, which hit his Foot. I asked
what the Matter was, for he seemed to be very
much frighted. He told me very seriously
that I should not lodge in that House, because
shortly a dead Coffin would be carried out of it,
for many were carrying of it when he was heard
cry. I neglecting his Words, and staying
there, he said to other of his Servants, he was
sorry for it, and that surely what he saw would
shortly come to pass. Tho no sick Person was
then there, yet the Landlord, a healthy Highlander,
died of ane appoplectick Fit before I
left the House.</p>

<p>In the year 1653, Alexander Monro (afterward
Lieut. Coll. to the Earl of Dunbarton’s
Regiment,) and I were walking in a Place
called Ullabill, in Lochbroom, on a little Plain,
at the Foot of a rugged Hill. There was a
Servant working with a Spade in the Walk
before us; his Back was to us, and his Face to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
the Hill. Before we came to him, he let the
Spade fall, and looked toward the Hill. He
took Notice of us as wee passed neer by him,
which made me look at him; and perceiving
him to stair a little strangely, I conjectured him
to be a Seer. I called at him, at which he
started and smiled. What are you doing? said
I. He answered, I have seen a very strange
Thing; ane Army of Englishmen, leeding of
Horses, coming doun that Hill; and a Number
of them are come down to the Plain, and eating
the Barley, which is growing in the Field
neer to the Hill. This was on the 4th May,
(for I notted the Day,) and it was four or fyve
Days before the Barley was sown in the Field
he spoke of. Alexander Monro asked him how
he knew they were Englishmen? He said,
because they were leeding of Horses, and had
on Hats and Bootts, which he knew no Scot
Man would have there. We took little Notice
of the whole Storie, as other than a foolish
Vision; but wished that ane English Partie
were there, we being then at Warr with them,
and the Place almost unaccessable for Horsemen.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
But in the Beginning of August therafter,
the Earle of Midleton (then Lieut. for
the King in the Highlands) having occasion to
march a Party of his toward the South Highlands,
he sent his Foot thorow a Place called
Inverlawell; and the Fore-partie which was
first down the Hill, did fall off eating the
Barley which was on the litle Plain under it.
And Monro calling to mynd what the Seer told
us, in May preceiding, he wrote of it, and sent
ane Express to me to Lochslin, in Ross, (where
I then was) with it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I had</span> Occasion once to be in Companie
where a Young Lady was, (excuse my not
naming of Persons,) and I was told there was
a notable Seer in the Companie. I called him
to speak with me, as I did ordinarly when I
found any of them; and after he had answered
me to several Questions, I asked if he knew any
Person to be in love with that Lady. He said
he did, but he knew not the Person; for during
the two Dayes he had been in her Company,
he perceaved one standing neer her, and his
Head leaning on her Shoulder; which he said<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
did fore-tell that the Man should marrie her,
and die before her, according to his Observation.
This was in the Year 1655. I desired
him to describe the Person, which he did; so
that I could conjecture, by the Description, of
such a one, who was of that Ladyes Acquaintance,
tho there were no thought of their Marriage
till two Years thereafter. And having
Occasion, in the Year 1657, to find this Seer,
who was ane Islander, in Company with the
other Person whom I conjectured to have been
described by him, I called him aside, and asked
if that was the Person he saw beside the Lady
near two Years then past. He said it was he
indeed, for he had seen that Lady just then
standing by him Hand in Hand. This was
some few Months before their Marriage, and
that Man is since dead, and the Lady still alive.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I shall</span> trouble you but with one more,
which I thought most remarkable of any that
occurred to me. In January 1652, the above
mentioned Lieut. Coll. Alex. Monro and I
happened to be in the House of one Wm.
M‘Cleud of Ferrinlea, in the County of Ross.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
He, the Landlord, and I were sitting in three
Chairs neir the Fire, and in the Corner of the
great Chimney there were two Islanders, who
were that verie Night come to the Hous, and
were related to the Landlord. While the one
of them was talking with Monro, I perceaved
the other to look oddly toward me. From this
Look, and his being ane Islander, I conjectured
him a Seer, and asked him, at what he stair’d?
He answered, by desiring me to rise from that
Chair, for it was ane unluckie one. I asked
him why. He answered, because there was a
dead Man in the Chair nixt to me. Well, said
I, if it be in the nixt Chair, I may keep mine
own. But what is the Likness of the Man?
He said he was a tall Man, with a long Grey
Coat, booted, and one of his Legs hanging over
the Arme of the Chair, and his head hanging
dead to the other Side, and his Arme backward,
as if it were brocken. There were some
English Troops then quartered near that Place,
and there being at that Time a great Frost after
a Thaw, the Country was covered all over with
Yce. Four or Fyve of the English ryding by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
this House some two Hours after the Vision,
while we were sitting by the Fire, we heard a
great Noise, which prov’d to be those Troopers,
with the Help of other Servants, carrying in
one of their Number, who had got a very mischeivous
Fall, and had his Arme broke; and
falling frequently in swooning Fits, they brought
him into the Hall, and set him in the verie
Chair, and in the verie Posture that the Seer
had prophesied. But the Man did not die,
though he recovered with great Difficulty.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Among</span> the Accounts given me by Sir Normand
M‘clud, there was one worth of special
Notice, which was thus. There [was] a Gentleman
in the Isle of Harris, who was always seen
by the Seers with ane Arrow in his Thigh.
Such in the Isle who thought those prognostications
infalliable, did not doubt but he would be
shot in the Thigh before he died. Sir Normand
told me that he heard it the Subject of
their Discourse for many Years. At last he
died without any such Accident. Sir Normand
was at his Buriall, at St Clement’s Church in
the Harris. At the same Time, the Corps of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
another Gentleman was brought to be buried
in the same verie Church. The Friends on
either Side came to debate who should first
enter the Church, and in a Trice from Words
they came to Blows. One of the Number (who
was arm’d with Bow and Arrows) let one fly
among them. (Now everie Familie in that Isle
have their Buriall-place in the Church in Stone
Chests, and the Bodies are carried in open
Biers to the Buriall-place.) Sir Normand
having appeased the Tumult, one of the Arrows
was found shot in the dead Man’s Thigh. To
this Sir Normand was a Witness.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the Account which Mr Daniel Morison,
Parson in the Lewis, gave me, there was one,
tho it be hetergeneous from the subject, yet it
may [be] worth your Notice. It was of a
young Woman in his Parish, who was mightily
frightned by seeing her own Image still before
her, alwayes when she came to the open Air;
the Back of the Image being alwayes to her,
so that it was not a reflection as in a Mirrour,
but the Species of such a Body as her own, and
in a very like Habit, which appeared to herself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
continually before her. The Parson keept her
a long whyle with him, but had no Remedy of
her Evill, which troubled her exceidingly. I
was told afterwards, that when she was four or
fyve Years elder she saw it not.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">These</span> are Matters of Fact, which I assure
yow they are truely related. But these, and all
others that occurred to me, by Information or
otherwise, could never lead me into a remote
Conjecture of the Cause of so extraordinary a
Phænomenon. Whither it be a Quality in the
Eyes of some People into these Pairts, concurring
with a Quality in the Air also; whither
such Species be every where, tho not seen by
the Want of Eyes so qualified, or from whatever
other Cause, I must leave to the Inquiry of
clearer Judgements than mine. But a Hint
may be taken from this image which appeared
still to this Woman abovementioned, and from
another mentioned by Aristotle, in the 4th of
his Metaphysicks (if I remember right, for it is
long since I read it;) as also from the common
Opinion that young Infants (unsullied with
many Objects) do sie Appearitions, which were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
not seen by those of elder Years; as like wise
from this, that severalls did sie the Second
Sight when in the Highlands or Isles, yet when
transported to live in other Countreys, especially
in America, they quite lose this Qualitie, as
was told me by a Gentleman who knew some
of them in Barbadoes, who did see no Vision
there, altho he knew them to be Seers when
they lived in the Isles of Scotland.</p>

<p class="center">Thus far my Lord Tarbett.</p>

<hr class="r30a">
<hr class="r30b">

<p><span class="smcap">My Lord</span>, after narrow Inquisition, hath delivered
many true and remarkable observes
on this Subject; yet to encourage a further
Scrutiny, I crave leave to say,</p>

<p><span class="smcap">That</span> 1. But a few Women are endued with
this Sight in respect of Men, and their Predictions
not so certane.</p>

<p>2. This Sight is not criminal, since a Man
can come by it unawares, and without his
Consent; but it is certaine he sie more fatall
and fearfull Things than he do gladsome.</p>

<p>3. <span class="smcap">The</span> Seers avouch, that severalls who go<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
to the <em>Siths</em>, (or People at Rest, and, in respect
of us, in Peace,) before the natural Period of
their Lyfe expyre, do frequently appear to
them.</p>

<p>4. <span class="smcap">A Vehement</span> Desyre to attain this Airt is
very helpfull to the Inquyrer; and the Species
of ane Absent Friend, which appears to the
Seers, as clearly as if he had sent his lively
Picture to present it selfe before him, is no
phantastick Shaddow of a sick Apprehension,
but a reality, and a Messinger, coming for unknown
Reasons, not from the originall Similitude
of it selfe, but from a more swift and
pragmantick People, which recreat them selves
in offering secret Intelligence to Men, tho
generally they are unacquainted with that Kind
of Correspondence, as if they had lived in a
different element from them.</p>

<p>5. <span class="smcap">Tho</span> my Collections were written long
before I saw My Lord of Tarbett’s, yet I am
glad that his descriptions and mine correspond
so nearly. The Maid my Lord mentions, who
saw her Image still before her, suteth with the
<span class="smcap">Co-Walker</span> named in my Account; which tho<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
some, at first Thought, might conjecture to be
by the Refraction of a Cloud or Mist, as in the
Parelij, (the whole Air and every Drop of
Water being a Mirrour to returne the Species
of Things, were our visive Faculty sharpe
enough to apprehend them,) or a naturall Reflexion,
from the same Reasons that an Echo
can be redoubled by Airt; yet it were more
fasable to impute this Second Sight to a
Quality infused into the Eye by ane Unction:
for Witchies have a sleepie Oyntment, that, when
applyed, troubles their Fantasies, advancing it
to have unusuall Figures and Shapes represented
to it, as if it were a Fit of Fanaticism,
Hypocondriack Melancholly, or Possession of
some insinuating Spirit, raising the Soul beyond
its common Strain, if the palpable Instances
and Realities seen, and innocently objected to
the Senses did not disprove it, make the Matter
a palpable Verity, and no Deception; yet since
this Sight can be bestowed without Oyntment,
or dangerous Compact, the Qualification is not
of so bad an Originall. Therefore,</p>

<p>6. <span class="smcap">By</span> my Lord’s good Leave, I presume to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
say, that this Sight can be no Quality of the
Air nor of the Eyes; becaus, 1. such as live
in the same Air, and sie all other Things as
farr off and as clearly, yet have not the <span class="smcap">Second
Sight</span>. 2. <span class="smcap">A Seer</span> can give another Person
this Sight transiently, by putting his Hand
and Foot in the Posture he requires of him.
3. The unsullied Eyes of Infants can naturally
perceave no new unaccustomed Objects, but
what appear to other Men, unless exalted
and clarified some Way, as Ballaam’s Ass for a
Time; tho in a Witches Eye the Beholder
cannot sie his own Image reflected, as in the
Eyes of other People; so that Defect of Objects,
as well as Diversities of the Subject,
may appear differently on severall Tempers
and Ages. 4. Tho also some are of so venemous
a Constitution, by being radicated in
Envy and Malice, that they pierce and kill
(like a Cockatrice) whatever Creature they first
set their Eye on in the Morning; so was it
with Walter Grahame, some Time living in
the Paroch wherein now I am, who killed his
own Cow after commending its Fatness, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
shot a Hair with his Eyes, having praised its
swiftness, (such was the Infection of ane evill
Eye;) albeit this was unusuall, yet he saw no
Object but what was obvious to other Men as
well as to himselfe. 5. If the being transported
to live in another Countrey did obscure
the Second Sight, nather the Parson nor the
Maid needed be much troubled for her Reflex-selfe;
a little Peregrination, and going from
her wonted Home, would have salved her
Fear. Wherefore,</p>

<p>7. <span class="smcap">Since</span> the Things seen by the Seers are
real Entities, the Presages and Predictions
found true, but a few endued with this Sight,
and those not of bad Lyves, or addicted to
Malifices, the true Solution of the Phænomenon
seems rather to be, the courteous Endeavours
of our fellow Creatures in the Invisible
World to convince us, (in Opposition to Sadduce’s,
Socinians, and Atheists,) of a Deity; of
Spirits; of a possible and harmless Method of
Correspondence betwixt Men and them, even
in this Lyfe; of their Operation for our Caution
and Warning; of the Orders and Degrees<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
of Angells, whereof one Order, with Bodies of
Air condensed and curiously shap’t, may be nixt
to Man, superior to him in Understanding, yet
unconfirmed; and of their Region, Habitation,
and Influences on Man, greater than that of
Starrs on inanimat Bodies; a Knowledge (be-like)
reserved for these last atheistick Ages,
wherein the Profanity of Mens Lives hath debauched
and blinded their Understanding, as
to <span class="smcap">Moses</span>, <span class="smcap">Jesus</span>, and the Prophets, (unless
they get Convictions from Things formerly
known,) as from the Regions of the Dead:
nor doth the ceasing of the Visions, upon the
Seers Transmigration into forrein Kingdoms,
make his Lordship’s Conjecture of the Quality
of the Air and Eye a white the more probable;
but, on the Contrary, it confirms greatly
my Account of ane Invisible People, guardian
over and care-full of Men, who have their
different Offices and Abilities in distinct Counterey’s,
as appears in Dan. 10. 13. viz. about
Israels, Grecia’s, and Persia’s assistant Princes,
whereof who so prevaileth giveth Dominion
and Ascendant to his Pupills and Vassalls over<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
the opposite Armies and Countreys; so that
every Countrey and Kingdom having their
topical Spirits, or Powers assisting and governing
them, the <span class="smcap">Scottish Seer</span> banished to
America, being a Stranger there, as well to
the invisible as to the visible Inhabitants, and
wanting a Fimiliarity of his former Correspondents,
he could not have the Favour and
Warnings, by the severall Visions and Predictions
which were wont to be granted him by
these Acquantances and Fayourites in his own
Countrey. For if what he wont to sie were
Realities, (as I have made appear,) ’twere too
great ane Honour for Scotland to have such
seldom-seen Watchers and predominant Powers
over it alone, acting in it so expressly, and all
other Nations wholly destitute of the lyke;
tho, without all peradventure, all other People
wanted the right Key of their Cabinet, and
the exact Method of Correspondence with them,
except the sagacious active Scots, as many of
them have retained it of a long Time, and by
Surpryses and Raptures do often foirtell what
in Kyndness is really represented to them at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
severall Occasions. To which Purpose the
learned lynx-ey’d Mr. Baxter, on Rev. 12. 7.
writting of the Fight betwixt Michaell and the
Dragon, gives a verie pertinent Note, viz. That
he knows not but ere any great Action (especiall
tragicall) is don on Earth, that first the Battell
and Victory is acted and atchieved in the Air
betwixt the good and evill Spirits: Thus he.
It seems these were the mens Guardians; and
the lyke Battells are oft tymes perceav’d in a
Loaft in the Nycht-time; the Event of which
myght easily be represented by some one of
the Number to a Correspondent on Earth, as
frequently the Report of great Actions have
been more swiftly caried to other Countreys
than all the Airt of us Mortals could possibly
dispatch it. St. Austine, on Mark, 9. 4. giveth
no small Intimation of this Truth, averring
that Elias appeared with Jesus on the Mount
in his proper Bodie, but Moses in ane aereall
Bodie, assumed like the Angels who appeared,
and had Ability to eat with Abraham, tho no
Necessity on the Account of their Bodies. As
lyke wise the late Doctrine of the Pre-existence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
of Souls, living into aereall Vehicles, gives a
singular Hint of the Possibility of the Thing,
if not a direct Prooff of the whole Assertion;
which yet moreover may be illuminated by
diverse other Instances of the lyke Nature,
and as wonderfull, besides what is above said.
As,</p>

<p>8. <span class="smcap">The</span> invisible Wights which haunt Houses
seem rather to be some of our subterranean
Inhabitants, (which appear often to Men of
the Second Sight,) than evill Spirits or Devills;
because, tho they throw great Stones, Pieces
of Earth and Wood, at the Inhabitants, they
hurt them not at all, as if they acted not
malitiously, like Devills at all, but in Sport,
lyke Buffoons and Drolls. All Ages have
affoorded some obscure Testimonies of it, as
Pythagoras his Doctrine of Transmigration;
Socrates’s Dæmon that gave him [Warning] of
future Dangers; Platoe’s classing them into
various vehiculated Specieses of Spirits; Dionisius
Areopagita’s marshalling nyne Orders of
Spirits, superiour and subordinate; the Poets
their borrowing of the Philosophers, and adding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
their own Fancies of Fountain, River, and
Sea Nymphs, Wood, Hill, and Montain Inhabitants,
and that every Place and Thing,
in Cities and Countreys, had speciall invisible
regular Gods and Governours. Cardan speaks
of his Father his seeing the Species of his
Friend, in a moon-shyn Night, riding fiercely
by his Window on a white Horse, the verie
Night his Friend dy’d at a Vast Distance from
him; by which he understood that some Alteration
would suddenly ensue. Cornelius Aggrippa,
and the learned Dr. Mor, have severall Passages
tending that Way. The Noctambulo’s
themselves would appear to have some forrein
joquing Spirit possessing and supporting them,
when they walk on deep Waters and Topes
of Houses without Danger, when asleep and
in the dark; for it was no way probable that
their Apprehension, and strong Imagination
setting the Animal Spirits a work to move the
Body, could preserve it from sinking in the
Deepth, or falling down head-long, when asleep,
any more than when awake, the Body being
then as ponderous as before; and it is hard<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
to attribute it to a Spirit flatelie evill and
Enemy to Man, because the Noctambulo returns
to his own Place safe. And the most
furious Tribe of the Dæmons are not permitted
by Providence to attacke Men so frequently
either by Night or by Day: For in
our Highlands, as there may be many fair
Ladies of this aereal Order, which do often
tryst with lascivious young Men, in the quality
of Succubi, or lightsome Paramours and Strumpets,
called <em>Leannain Sith</em>, or familiar Spirits
(in Dewter. 18. 11.); so do many of our
Hyghlanders, as if a strangling by the Night
<span class="smcap">Mare</span>, pressed with a fearfull Dream, or rather
possessed by one of our aereall Neighbours, rise
up fierce in the Night, and apprehending the
neerest Weapons, do push and thrust at all
Persons in the same Room with them, sometymes
wounding their own Comerades to dead.
The lyke whereof fell sadly out within a few
Miles of me at the writting hereof. I add
but one Instance more, of a very young Maid,
who lived neir to my last Residence, that in
one Night learned a large Peice of Poesy, by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
the frequent Repetition of it, from one of our
nimble and courteous Spirits, whereof a Part
was pious, the rest superstitious, (for I have a
Copy of it,) and no other Person was ever
heard to repeat it before, nor was the Maid
capable to compose it of herself.</p>

<p>9. He demonstrated and made evident to
Sense this extraordinary Vision of our Tramontain
Seers, and what is seen by them, by
what is said above, many haveing seen this
same Spectres and Apparitions at once, haveing
their visive Faculties entire; for <i lang="la">non est
disputandum de gustu</i>. Itt now remaines to
shew that it is not unsutable to Reason nor
the Holy Scriptures.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">First</span>, That it is not repugnant to Reason,
doeth appear from this, that it is no less strange
for Immortal Sparks and Souls to come and
be immersed into gross terrestrial elementary
Bodies, and be so propagated, so nourished,
so fed, soe cloathed as they are, and breathe
in such ane Air and World prepared for them,
then for Hollanders or Hollow-cavern Inhabitants
to live and traffick among us, in another<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
State of Being, without our Knowledge. For
Raymond de Subinde, in his 3d Booke, Chap.
12. argues quaintly, that all Sorts of Living
Creatures have a happie rational Politie of
there own, with great Contentment; which
Government and mutual Converse of theirs
they all pride and pluim themselves, because
it is as unknown to Man, as Man is to them.
Much more, that the Sone of the <span class="smcap">Highest
Spirit</span> should assume a Bodie like ours, convinces
all the World that no other Thing that
is possible needs be much wondered at.</p>

<p>2. The Manucodiata, or Bird of Paradise,
living in the highest Region of the Air; common
Birds in the second Region; Flies and
Insects in the lowest; Men and Beasts on the
Earth’s Surface; Worms, Otters, Badgers, in
Waters; lyke wise Hell is inhabited at the
Centre, and Heaven in the Circumference:
can we then think the middle Cavities of the
Earth emptie? I have seen in Weems, (a
Place in the Countie of Fyfe, in Scotland,)
divers Caves cut out as vast Temples under
Ground; the lyke is a Countie of England;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
in Malta is a Cave, wherein Stons of a curious
Cut are thrown in great Numbers every Day;
so I have had barbed Arrow-heads of yellow
Flint, that could not be cut so small and
neat, of so brittle a Substance, by all the Airt
of Man. It would seem therefoir that these
mention’d Works were done by certaine Spirits
of pure Organs, and not by Devills, whose
continual Torments could not allow them so
much Leasure. Besides these, I have found
fyve Curiosities in Scotland, not much observ’d
to be elsewhere. 1. The Brounies, who in
some Families are Drudges, clean the Houses
and Dishes after all go to Bed, taking with
him his Portion of Food and removing befor
Day-break. 2. The Mason Word, which tho
some make a Misterie of it, I will not conceal
a little of what I know. It is lyke a Rabbinical
Tradition, in way of Comment on Jachin
and Boaz, the two Pillars erected in Solomon’s
Temple, (1 Kings, 7. 21.) with ane Addition
of some secret Signe delyvered from Hand
to Hand, by which they know and become
familiar one with another. 3. This Second<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
Sight, so largely treated of before. 4. Charmes,
and curing by them very many Diseases, sometimes
by transferring the Sicknes to another.
5. A being Proof of Lead, Iron, and Silver,
or a Brieve making Men invulnerable. Divers
of our Scottish Commanders and Souldiers have
been seen with blue Markes only, after they
were shot with leaden Balls; which seems to
be an Italian Trick, for they seem to be a
People too currious and magically inclyned,
Finally Iris-men, our Northern-Scotish, and our
Athole Men are so much addicted to and
delighted with Harps and Musick, as if, like
King Saul, they were possessed with a forrein
Spirit, only with this Difference, that Musick
did put Saul’s Pley-fellow a sleep, but roused
and awaked our Men, vanquishing their own
Spirits at Pleasure, as if they were impotent
of its Powers, and unable to command it; for
wee have seen some poor Beggers of them,
chattering their Teeth for Cold, that how soon
they saw the Fire, and heard the Harp, leapt
thorow the House like Goats and Satyrs. As
there paralell Stories in all Countries and Ages<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
reported of these our obscure People, (which
are no Dotages,) so is it no more of Necessitie
to us fully to know their Beings and Manner
of Life, then to understand distinctly the Politie
of the nyne Orders of Angels; or with what
Oyl the Lamp of the Sun is maintained so
long and regularlie; or why the Moon is called
a great Luminary in Scripture, while it only
appears to be so; or if the Moon be truly
inhabited, because Telescopes discover Seas
and Mountains in it, as well as flaming Furnishes
in the Sun; or why the Discovery of
America was look’t on as a Fairie Tale, and
the Reporters hooted at as Inventors of ridiculous
Utopias, or the first probable Asserters
punished as Inventures of new Gods and
Worlds; or why in England the King cures
the Struma by stroaking, and the Seventh Son
in Scotland; whither his temperat Complexion
conveys a Balsome, and sucks out the corrupting
Principles by a frequent warme sanative
Contact, or whither the Parents of the Seventh
Child put furth a more eminent Virtue to his
Production than to all the Rest, as being the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
certain Meridian and hight to which their
Vigour ascends, and from that furth have a
graduall declyning into a feebleness of the
Bodie and its Production. And then, 1. Why
is not the 7th Son infected himselfe by that
Contagion he extracts from another? 2. How
can continual stroaking with a cold Hand have
foe strong a natural Operation, as to exhale
all the Infections warming corroding Vapours.
3. Why may not a 7th Daughter have the
same Vertue? So that it appears, albeit, a
happie natural Constitution concurre, yet something
in it above Nature. Therefore every
Age hath left some secret for its Discoverie;
who knows but this Entercourse <ins id="tn-67" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'bewixt the two'">
betwixt the two</ins> Kinds of rationall Inhabitants of the same
Earth may be not only beleived shortly, but
as friely entertain’d, and as well known, as
now the Airt of Navigation, Printing, Limning,
riding on Saddles with Stirrups, and the Discoveries
of Microscopes, which were sometimes
a great a Wonder, and as hard to be beleived.</p>

<p>10. <span class="smcap">Tho</span> I will not be so curious nor so
peremptorie as he who will prove the Posibility<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
of the Philosopher’s Stone from Scripture,
Job, 28. 1. 2. Job, 22. 24. 25.; or the
Pluralitie of Worlds, from John, 14. 2. and
Hebrews ij. 3.; nor the Circulation of Blood
from Eccles. 12. and 6.; nor the Tanismanical
Airt, from the Blind and Lame mentioned
in 2d of Samuel, 5. 6. yet I humblie propose
these Passages which may give some Light to
our Subject at least, and show that this Polity
and Rank of People is not a Thing impossible,
nor the modest and innocent Scrutiny of them
impertinent or unsafe. The Legion or Brigad
of Spirits (mentioned Mark, 5. 10.) besought
our Saviour not to send them away out of the
Countrey; which shows they were <span class="smcap">Dæmones
Loci</span>, Topical Spirits, and peculiar Superintendents
and Supervisors assign’d to that Province.
And the Power over the Nations
granted (Rev. 2. 26.) to the Conquerors of
Vice and Infidelitie, Sound somewhat to that
Purpose. Tobit had a Dæmon attending
Marriage, Chap. 6. Verse, 15; and in Matth.
4. and 5. ane evill Spirit came in a Visible
Shape to tempt our Saviour, who himselfe<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
denyed not the sensible appearing of Ghosts
to our Sight, but said, their Bodies were not
composed of Flesh and Bones, as ours, Luke,
24. 39. And in Philip. 2. 10. our verie Subterraneans
are expressly said to bow to the
Name of <span class="smcap">Jesus</span>. Elisha, not intellectually only,
but sensibly, saw Gehazi when out of the Reach
of ane ordinary View. It wants not good
Evidents that there are more managed by
God’s Spirits, good, evill, and intermediate
Spirits, among Men in this World, then we
are aware of; the good Spirits ingesting fair
and heroick Apprehensions and Images of
Vertue and the divyne Life, thereby animating
us to act for a higher Happines, according
to our Improvement; and relinquishing us as
strangely upon our Neglect, or our embraceing
the deceatfull syrene-like Pictures and Representations
of Pleasures and Gain, presented
to our Imaginations by evill and sportfull
Angells, to allure to ane unthinking, ungenerous,
and sensual Lyfe; non of them having
power to compell us to any Misdemeanour
without our flat Consent. Moreover, this Life<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
of ours being called a Warfair, and God’s saying
that at last there will be no Peace to the
Wicked, our bussie and silent Companions also
being called <em>Siths</em>, or <em>People at Rest and Quiet</em>,
in respect of us; and withall many Ghosts
appearing to Men that want this <em>Second Sight</em>,
in the very Shapes, and speaking the same
Language, they did when incorporate and alive
with us; a Matter that is of ane old imprescriptible
Tradition, (<em>our Highlanders</em> making
still a Distinction betwixt <em>Sluagh Saoghalta</em>
and <em>Sluagh Sith</em>, averring that the Souls goe
to the <em>Sith</em> when dislodged;) many real Treasures
and Murders being discovered by Souls
that pass from among our selves, or by the
Kindness of these our airie Neighbours, non
of which Spirits can be altogither inorganical.
No less than the Conseits about Purgatory, or
a State of Rescue; the <i lang="la">Limbus Patrum et Infantum</i>,
Inventions, [which] tho misapplyed, yet
are not Chimæras, and altogither groundless.
For <i lang="la">ab origine</i>, it is nothing but blansh and
faint Discoveries of this <span class="smcap">Secret Republick</span> of
ours here treated on, and additional Fictions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
of Monks doting and crazied Heads, our Creed
saying that our Saviour descended εἰς ᾅδου, to the
invisible Place and People. And many Divines
supposing that the Deity appear’d in a visible
Shape seen by Adam in the Cooll of the Day,
and speaking to him with ane audible voice.
And Jesus, probably by the Ministery of invisible
Attendants, conveying more meat of the
same Kind to the fyve Thowsand that wes fed
by him with a very few Loaves and Fishes,
(for a new Creation it was not.) The Zijmjiim
and Ochim, in Isa. 13. 21. 22. Thes
Satyres, and doolfull unknown Creatures of
Islands and Deserts, seem to have a plain Prospect
that Way. Finally, the eternal Happiness
enjoyed in the 3d Heavens, being more
mysterious than most of Men take it to be.
It is not a sense whollie adduced to Scripture
to say, that this <span class="smcap">Sight</span>, and the due Objects
of it, hath some Vestige in holy Write, but
rather ’tis modestly deduced from it.</p>

<p>11. It only now remains to ansear the obvious
Objections against the Reality and Lawfullness
of this Speculation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Question</span> 1. How do you salve the Second
Sight from Compact and Witchcraft?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Answer.</span> Tho this Correspondence with the
Intermediate Unconfirm’d People (betwixt Man
and Angell) be not ordinary to all of us who
are Superterraneans, yet this <span class="smcap">Sight</span> falling some
Persons by Accident, and its being connatural
to others from their Birth, the Derivation of it
cannot always be wicked. A too great Curiositie,
indeed, to acquyre any unnecessary Airt,
may be blameworthy; but diverse of the
<span class="smcap">Secret Commonwealth</span> may, by Permission,
discover themselves as innocently to us, who are
in another State, as some of us Men do to
Fishes, which are in another Element, when we
plunge and dive into the Bottom of the Seas,
their native Region; and in Process of Time we
may come to converse as familiarly with these
nimble and agile Clans (but with greater Pleasure
and Profit,) as we do now with the Chino’s
Antipodes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Question</span> 2. Are they subject to Vice,
Lusts? Passion, and Injustice, as we who live
on the Surface of the Earth?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Answer.</span> The Seers tell us that these wandering
Aereal People have not such an Impetus
and fatall Tendency to any Vice as Men, as
not being drenched into so gross and dregy
Bodies as we, but yet are in ane imperfect
State, and some of them making better Essays
for heroick Actions than others; having the
same Measures of Vertue and Vice as wee, and
still expecting advancement to a higher and
more splendid State of Lyfe. One of them is
stronger than many Men, yet do not incline to
hurt Mankind, except by Commission for a gross
Misdemeanour, as the destroying Angell of
Ægypt, and the Assyrians, Exod. 12. 29. 2
Kings, 10. 35. They haunt most where is most
Barbaritie; and therefoir our ignorant Ancestors,
to prevent the Insults of that strange
People, used as rude and course a Remedie;
such as Exorcisms, Donations, and Vows: But
how soon ever the true Piety prevailed in any
Place, it did not put the Inhabitants beyond
the Reach and Awthoritie of these subtile inferiour
Co-inhabitants and Colleagues of ours:
The <span class="smcap">Father of all Spirits</span>, and the Person<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
himselfe, having the only Command of his Soul
and Actions, a concurrance they may have to
what is virtuously done; for upon committing
of a foul Deed, one will find a Demure upon
his Soul, as if his cheerfull Collegue had deserted
him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Question</span> 3. Do these airie Tribes procreate?
If so, how are they nourished, and at
what period of Time do they die?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Answer.</span> Supposing all Spirits to be created
at once in the Beginning, Souls to pre-exist and
to circle about into several States of Probationship;
to make them either totally unexcusable,
or perfectly happie against the last Day, solves
all the Difficulties. But in very Deed, and
speaking suteable to the Nature of Things, there
is no more Absurditie for a Spirit to inform ane
Infant in Bodie of Airs, than a Bodie composed
of dull and drusie Earth; the best of Spirits
have alwayes delyghted more to appear into
aereal, than into terrestrial Bodyes. They feed
most what on Quintessences, and aetheriall
Essences. The Pith and Spirits only of
Women’s Milk feed their Children, being artificially<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
conveyed, (as Air and Oyl sink into our
Bodies,) to make them vigorous and fresh.
And this shorter Way of conveying a pure Aliment,
(without the usuall Digestions,) by transfusing
it, and transpyring thorow the Pores into
the Veins, Arteries, and Vessells that supplie the
Bodie, is nothing more absurd, than ane Infant’s
being fed by the Navel before it is borne, or
than a Plant, which groweth by attracting a
livelie Juice from the Earth thorow many small
Roots and Tendons, whose courser Pairts be
adapted and made connatural to the Whole,
doth quickly coalesce by the ambient Cold;
and so are condens’d and bak’d up into a confirm’d
Wood in the one, and solid Bodie of the
Flesh and Bone in the other. A Notion which,
if intertained and approv’d, may shew that the
late Invention of soaking and transfusing (not
Blood, but) athereal virtuall Spirits, may be usefull
both for Nourishment and Health, whereof
is a Vestige in the damnable Practise of evill
Angells, their sucking of Blood and Spirits out
of Witches Bodys (till they drew them into a
deform’d and dry Leanness,) to feid their own<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
Vehicles withall, leaving what we call the
Witches Mark behind; a Spot that I have
seen, as a small Mole, horny, and brown-coloured;
throw which Mark, when a large
Brass Pin was thrust (both in Buttock, Nose,
and Rooff of the Mouth,) till it bowed and
become crooked, the Witches, both Men and
Women, nather felt a Pain, nor did bleed, nor
knew the precise Time when this was adoing to
them, (there Eyes only being covered.) Now
the Air being a Body as well as Earth, no
Reason can be given why there may not be
Particles of more vivific Spirit form’d of it for
Procreation, then is possible to be of Earth,
which takes more Time and Pains to rarify and
ripen it, ere it can come to have a prolific
Virtue. And if our Aping Darlings did not
thus procreate, there whole Number would be
exhausted after a considerable Space of Time.
For tho they are of more refyned Bodies and
Intellectualls than wee, and of far less heavy
and corruptive Humours, (which cause a Dissolution,)
yet many of their Lives being dissonant
to right Reason and their own Laws,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
and their Vehicles not being wholly frie of Lust
and Passion, especially of the more spirituall
and hautie Sins they pass (after a long healthy
Lyfe) into one Orb and Receptacle fitted for
their Degree, till they come under the general
Cognizance of the last Day.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Question</span> 4. Doth the acquiring of this
Second Sight make any Change on the Acquirers
Body, Mind, or Actions?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Answer.</span> All uncouth <span class="smcap">Sights</span> enfeebles the
<span class="smcap">Seer</span>. Daniel, tho familiar with divyne Visions,
yet fell frequently doun without Strength, when
dazzled with a Power which had the Ascendant
of, and passed on him beyond his Comprehension,
Chap. 10. 8. 17. So our <span class="smcap">Seer</span> is put in
a Rapture, Transport, and sort of Death, as
divested of his Body and all its Senses, when
he is first made participant of this curious
Peice of Knowledge: But it maketh no Wramp
or Strain in the Understanding of any; only to
the Fancy’s of clownish or illiterate Men, it
creates some Affrightments and Disturbances,
because of the Strongness of the Showes, and
their Unacquaintedness with them. And as for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
their Lyfe, the Persons endued with this Rarity
are, for the most Part, candid, honest, and
sociable People. If any of them be subject to
Immoralities, this obstruse Skill is not to be
blamed for it; for unless themselves be the
Tempters, the Colonies of the Invisible Plantations,
with which they intercommune, do provoke
them by no Villainy or Malifice, nather
at their first Acquaintance nor after a long
Familiarity.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Question</span> 5. Doth not Sathan interpose in
such Cases by many subtile unthought Insinuations,
as to him who let the Fly, or Familiar,
go out of the Box, and yet found the Fly of his
own putting in, as serviceable as the other
would have been?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Answer.</span> The Goodness of the Lyfe, and
Designs of the ancient Prophets and Seers, was
one of the best Prooffs of their Mission.<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></p>

<p class="noindent">In trying to collect evidence as to the Rerrick
“evil spirit” from Kirk-Session Records, I
have been most kindly assisted by the Rev.
Mr. M‘Conachie, Minister of Rerrick. Mr.
M‘Conachie finds that only two parishes in the
Stewartry, Kells and Girthon, have records containing
the years 1695, 1696. The records of
Rerrick do not go so far back. We are therefore
left to the pamphlet of 1696, by Telfair,
which is an unusually business-like statement,
the names of attesting witnesses being added in
the marginal notes. For phenomena singularly

<p>The Psychical Society, as far as the writer is aware

<div class="blockquot">

<p>That the voice of spirits is a kind of whistling, twittering,
or chirping, is a very widely diffused and ancient
belief. The ghosts in Homer twitter like bats; in New
Caledonia an English settler found that he could scare
the natives from a piece of ground by whistling there at
night. Mr. Samuel Wesley says, “I followed the noise
into almost every room in the house, both by day and
by night, with lights and without, and have sat alone
for some time, and, when I heard the noise, spoke to it
to tell me what it was, but never heard any articulate
voice, and only once or twice two or three feeble squeaks,
a little louder than the chirping of a bird, and not like
the noise of rats, which I have often heard” (<cite>Memoirs of
the Wesley Family</cite>, p. 164). Professor Alexander mentions
the “pecular whistling sound” at some manifestations
in Rio Janeiro as “rather frequent” (<cite>Proc. S. P. R.</cite>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
xix. 180). Here children were the mediums; how did
they get the idea of the traditional whistle? See also

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The phenomena alluded to here are said to have
occurred in 1549. The evidence is a mere report by
Cieza de Leon, who does not pretend to have been an
eye-witness. But, as Mr. Clements Markham, Cieza’s
editor, remarks, the phenomena are analogous to those
of spiritualism. At the very least, we find a belief in
this kind of manifestation at a remote date, and in an
outlandish place. Cieza says:<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></p>

<p>“When the Adelantado Belalcazar was governor of
the province of Popyan, and when Gomez Hernandez
was his lieutenant in the town of Auzerma, there was a
chief in a village called Pirsa, almost four leagues from
the town, whose brother, a good-looking youth named
Tamaraqunga, inspired by God, wished to go to the
town of the Christians to receive baptism. But the
devils did not wish that he should attain his desire,
fearing to lose what seemed secure, so they frightened
this Tamaraqunga in such sort that he was unable to do
anything. God permitting it, the devils stationed themselves
in a place where the chief alone could see them,
in the shape of birds called <em>auras</em>. Finding himself so
persecuted by the devils, he sent in great haste to a
Christian living near, who came at once, and hearing
what he wanted, signed him with the sign of the cross.
But the devils then frightened him more than ever,
appearing in hideous forms, which only were visible to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
him. <em>The Christian only saw stones falling from the air
and heard whistling.</em> A brother of one Juan Pacheco,
citizen of the same town, then holding office in the
place of Gomez Hernandez, who had gone to Caramanta,
came from Auzerma with another man to visit
the Indian chief. They say that Tamaraqunga was
much frightened and ill-treated by the devils, who
carried him through the air from one place to another
in presence of the Christians, he complaining and the
devils whistling and shouting. Sometimes when the
chief was sitting with a glass of liquor before him, the
Christians saw the glass raised up in the air and put
down empty, and a short time afterwards the wine was
again poured into the cup from the air.” Compare what
Ibn Batuta, the old Arab traveller, saw at the court of
the King of Delhi. The matter is discussed in Colonel
Yule’s <cite>Marco Polo</cite>.</p>

<p>This may suffice as a specimen of the manifestations.
They continued while the chief was on his way to
church; he was lifted into the air, and the Christians
had to hold him down. In church the ghostly whistling
was heard, and stones fell around, while the chief said
that he saw devils standing upside down, and himself
was thrown into that unusual posture. The combination
of convulsive movements with the other phenomena is
that which we have already remarked in the cases of
“Mr. H.” and the grandson of William Morse. Cieza de
Leon says that the chief was not troubled after his baptism.
The illusions of the newly-converted, so like those of the
early Christian hermits, are described by Callaway in his
<cite>Zulu Tales</cite>.</p>

Coleridge, on the other hand, says that “all these stories,
and I could produce fifty cases at least equally well
authenticated, and, as far as the veracity of the narrators,
and the single fact of their having seen and heard
such and such sights or sounds, above all rational scepticism,
are as much like one another as the symptoms of
the same disease in different patients.”</p>

<p>It is a pity that Coleridge did not produce his fifty well-authenticated
examples. The similarity of the narratives
everywhere, all the world over, is exactly what makes them
interesting. Coleridge goes on: “This indeed I take to be
the true and only solution—a contagious nervous disease,
the acme, or intensest form of which is catalepsy”
(Southey’s <cite>Wesley</cite>, vol. i. p. 14, Coleridge’s note). If
there be such a contagious nervous disease, it is a very
remarkable malady, and well worth examining. The
Wesleys were not alarmed; they bantered the spirit;
they wished they could set him to work; and beyond
the trembling of the children when Jeffrey was knocking
during their sleep, there is no sign of morbid conditions.
A neighbouring clergyman, who was asked to pass a
night in the house, saw and heard just what the others
heard and saw.<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> The hypothesis of a contagious nervous
disease, in which every witness exhibits the same symptoms
of illusion in all parts of the world, is a theory
which needs a good deal of verification. Where material
traces of the disturbances remain, it is absurd to
speak of contagious hallucinations. We must fall back
on the hypothesis of trickery, or must say with Southey,
“Such things may be preternatural, yet not miraculous;
they may not be in the ordinary course of nature, yet
imply no alteration of its laws.” Any theory is more
plausible than the idea that Mr. Wesley and Mr. Hoole<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
were in a state bordering on catalepsy. Believers in
hypnotism may think it possible that this, that, and the
other persons, if they submitted themselves to hypnotic
influences, might have the same hallucinations suggested
to them. But there is no evidence, in the Epworth
case nor in the Rerrick case, of any such matter. “So
far as we yet know, sensory hallucination of several
persons together, <em>who are not in a hypnotic state</em>, is a
rare phenomenon, and therefore not a probable explanation”
(<cite>Proc. S. P. R.</cite>, iv. 62). There is some evidence
that epileptic patients suffer from the same illusions—for
example, the presence of a woman in a red cloak;
and in <i lang="la">delirium tremens</i> the “horrors” are usually
similar. But that all the persons who enter a given
house should be impressed by the same material illusions,
as of chairs and tables, and even beds (like Nancy
Wesley’s) flying about, is a theory more incredible than
the hypothesis either of trickery or of abnormal occurrences.
When the disturbances always cease on the
arrival of a competent witness, then it is not hard to say
which theory we ought to choose. For imposture see
next note.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The phenomena discussed are most frequently connected
with children, who may be regarded either as
mediums or impostors, conscious or unconscious. In
<cite>Proc. S. P. R.</cite>, iv. 25-42, Professor Barrett gives the
case of a little girl whom he knew. She had raps wherever
she went, even when alone with the Professor, who
made her stand with her hands against the wall, at the
greatest stretch of her arms, “with the muscles of the
legs and arms all in tension.” “A brisk pattering of
raps” followed Professor Barrett’s request. But he
also mentions a boy “of juvenile piety,” who “for twelve<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
months deceived his father, a <ins id="tn-86" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'distingnished surgeon'">
distinguished surgeon</ins>, and
all his family, by pretended spiritualistic manifestations,
which appeared at first sight inexplicable, until the
cunning trickery of the lad was discovered.” The only
difference between these cases is that an “outsider”
discovered trickery in one instance and not in the other.
This is a very ticklish kind of certainty, and it is plain
that children can do a great deal in the way of mere
imposture. The state of any young Wesley who might
have been caught out is unenviable. Verily Mr. Wesley
would not have spared for his crying.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The arrows are the ancient flint arrow-heads, which
Mr. Kirk later asserts to be too delicate for human
artificers. On this matter Isabel Gowdie, the witch,
confessed, “As for Elf arrows, the Divell sharpes them
with his ain hand, and deliveris them to Elf boys, wha
whyttlis and dightis them with a sharp thing lyk a
paking needle; bot whan I was in Elfland, I saw them
whyttling and dighting them.” Isabel described the
manner in which witches use this artillery: “We spang
them from the naillis of our thoombs,” and with these
she and her friends shot and slew many men and women.
The confessions of Isabel Gowdie are in the third volume
of Pitcairn’s <cite>Scottish Criminal Trials</cite>. They contain little
or nothing of the “psychical;” all is mere folk-lore,
fairy tales, and charms derived from the old Catholic
liturgy. The poor woman, having begun to fable, fabled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
with manifest enjoyment and considerable power. It
seems from her account that each “Covin,” or assembly
of witches, had a maiden in it, and “without our maiden
we could do no great thing.” On the other hand, an
extraordinary case of an epileptic boy, who was hurled
about, and beheld distant occurrences in trance, may be
read in Chambers’s <cite>Domestic Annals of Scotland</cite>, iii. 449.
Candles used to go out when this boy, a third son of
Lord Torpichen, was in the room. The date (1720) and
the place (Mid-Lothian) prevented any one from being
burned for bewitching him. A fast was proclaimed.
The boy recovered, and did good service in the navy.
He is said to have been “levitated” frequently.</p>

Devil’s name, and thereby take with us the cow’s milk.”</p>

It is amusing to find a learned German coinciding in
scientific theory with “ignorant and unwary” Highland

germ of the Fairy myth is the existence of dispossessed
aboriginals dwelling in subterranean houses, in some

The lights seen near the mounds are lights actually

<h2 class="p4 nobreak" id="POSTSCRIPT">POSTSCRIPT.</h2>


<p class="noindent">It has been said that no trace can be found of
a printed <cite>Secret Commonwealth</cite> before 1815.
The present editor is inclined to believe that in
1699 the work was still in manuscript. In a
letter of Lord Reay’s to Mr. Samuel Pepys (Oct.
24, 1699), he says, “I have got a manuscript
since I last came to Scotland, whose author,
though a parson, after giving a very full account
of the Second Sight, defends there being no sin
in it.... With the first opportunity I shall
send you a copy of his books.” This description
answers very well to Mr. Kirk’s treatise,
and to no other contemporary work with which
I am acquainted, unless it be <cite>A Discourse of the
Second Sight</cite>, by the Rev. Mr. John Frazer,
minister of Tiree and Coll. There were, doubtless,
other parsons busy with these topics; and
the minister of Rerrick informs me that several
MSS. by Mr. Telfair, author of the tract already<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
quoted, were only dispersed about 1877. Examples
of these clerical psychical researchers
may be found in C. K. Sharpe’s prefatory notice
to Law’s <cite>Memorials</cite> (Edinburgh, 1818). Such
an one is the Rev. Robert Knox, who writes
from Cavers to the Rev. Mr. Wyllie on the case
of Sir George Maxwell of Pollock. He dare
not attribute the mediumship of Janet Douglas
“positively to an evil cause.... <em>It is our
ignorance of any natural agent</em> that makes us
impute the effects to evil spirits” (<cite>Memorials</cite>,
p. lxxv). Moreover, Lord Reay writes as if his
“parson” were still alive in 1699, whereas Mr.
Kirk “went to his own herd” in 1692. “I am
promised the acquaintance of this man, of which
I am very covetous.” Lord Reay was at Durness,
and may not have heard of the mishap
which carried the minister of Aberfoyle into
Fairyland. It may be added that Dr. Hickes
writes to Mr. Pepys about neolithic arrow heads
as “a subject of near alliance to that of the
Second Sight, and of witchcraft, which is akin
to them both.” He also speaks of “a very
tragical, but authentic story told me by the
Duke of Lauderdale, which happened in the
family of Sir John Dalrymple, Laird of Stair,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
and then Lord President. His Grace had no
sooner told it me, but my Lord President coming
into the room, he desired my Lord to tell it
himself, which, altering his countenance, he did
with a very melancholick air; but it is so long
since that I dare not trust my memory with
relating the particulars of it” (June 19, 1700).</p>

<p>Dr. Hickes calls the first Lord Stair “John,”
Scott calls him “James.” There can be no
doubt that Dr. Hickes refers to the woful tale
of the bride of Lammermoor, who died on September
12, 1669. Law, in his <cite>Memorials</cite>, says
she “was harled through the house”—by spirits,
he means. This “harling” or tossing about of
a patient, probably epileptic, we have noticed
in many of the old stories, as in the modern
instance of “Mr. H.” Now, in his Introduction
to the <cite>Bride of Lammermoor</cite>, Scott gives all
the authorities at his command: Law, Symson’s
<cite>Elegie</cite>, and Hamilton of Whitelaw’s <cite>Satire</cite>, which
avers that Satan seized the bride and “threw
the bridegroom from the nuptial bed.” Sir
Walter was unacquainted with Dr. Hickes’ hint,
which actually produces the bride’s own father as
evidence for a story which was plainly regarded
as supernatural. It is most unlucky that Dr.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
Hickes distrusted his memory. However, it is
something to feel assured that “a memorable
story” was accepted at the time by the family
of the bride, and was known to Lauderdale.<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a>
Lauderdale himself, by the way, was a psychical
researcher, and accommodated Richard Baxter
with some accounts of haunted houses, published
in his <cite>World of Spirits</cite>. One story of a haunted
house, where a spectral hand appeared, he gives
on the authority of “the Rev. James Sharp,”
afterwards the famous Archbishop. Lauderdale
inspected the famed Loudun nuns, and saw
only “wanton wenches singing baudy songs in
French.” His letter to Mr. Baxter is dated
March 12, 1659. His best haunted house is of
the Epworth type.</p>

<p lang="fr">“Ces deux volumes de la ‘Bibliothèque de Carabas’ (Bidpai et Æsop) constituent
l’examen le plus complet et le plus savant qui ait été fait depuis Benfey de cette
grande question de l’origine et de la migration des fables, et la critique de l’auteur s’y
montre partout aussi sage que bien informée.”—<span class="smcap">M. A. Barth</span>, in <cite lang="fr">Mélusine</cite>.</p>

<p>“The degree and quality of the editor’s learning are not to be doubted; it is
varied, profound, and without a spice of pedantry.”—<cite>Scots Observer.</cite></p>

<p><b>VI. THE ATTIS OF CAIUS VALERIUS CATULLUS.</b> Translated

Attis, on the Origin of Tree-Worship, and on the Galliambic

Merton College, Oxford. (xvi. 154 pp.) 1892. 7<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i></p>
</div>

<div class="blockquotx">

<p>“The paramount interest of this book lies in its two disquisitions upon the
meaning of the Attis myth and upon the meaning of tree-worship.”—<cite>Speaker.</cite></p>

<p>“As a contribution to folk-lore it is of real value and interest, and to a considerable
extent new in the line it takes.”—<cite>Literary World.</cite></p>

<p>“This theory, in which ‘the ghost plays ... the same part that guano and
phosphates play to-day,’ when stated thus baldly sounds strange, but when read in
the author’s own vivacious narrative, along with the excellent illustrations which he
brings forward, it is singularly attractive.”—<cite>Bookman.</cite></p>

<p>“Highly interesting, and at this time will probably fall in with prevailing
opinions.”—<span class="smcap">Robinson Ellis</span> in <cite>The Academy</cite>.</p>

<p>“Whether readers adopt Mr. Allen’s conclusions or net, all must agree that he
has propounded a most interesting theory, and stated it in a manner forcible and
stimulating to thought.”—<cite>Nation.</cite></p>

and the Eating of Beans. (cxxviii. 170 pp.) 1892. 10<i>s.</i></p>

<p>“Mr. Jevons’s essay is learned and interesting, and in some cases he has probably
found out the reason of behaviour which the Romans could not account for themselves.”—<cite>Daily
News</cite>, Jan. 10, 1893.</p>

<p>“All antiquaries and folk-lorists will thank him for enabling them to peruse in a
convenient form that part of Plutarch’s ‘Moralia’ which bears upon their science.”—<cite>Daily
Chronicle</cite>, Jan. 6, 1893.</p>

<p>“An admirable essay on Roman religion and on the characteristics of Aryan
religion.”—<cite>Glasgow Herald</cite>, Jan. 5, 1893.</p>

<p>“Holland’s quaintness and homely vigour make his translations delightful reading.
A most valuable and interesting introduction is supplied by a sound scholar
and shrewd thinker, Mr. F. B. Jevons.”—<cite>Athenæum</cite>, Jan. 7, 1893.</p>

<p>“Holland’s translation, a delightful piece of Elizabethan English, as Mr. Jevons
says, provides a seemly garb for Plutarch’s ancient reasonings. Mr. Jevons’s own
contribution to the volume is, as a help towards a true interpretation, of scarcely
less value than the translation itself.”—<cite>Scotsman</cite>, Dec. 26, 1892.</p>

<p>“Mr. Jevons’s introduction is at once learned and readable.”—<cite>Times</cite>, Dec. 22,
1892.</p>

<p>“The editor has supplied an excellent commentary upon some of the most striking
parts in a series of dissertations on Italian cults, myths, taboos, man-worship, Aryan
marriage, sympathetic magic, and the eating of beans. The mere titles of these
essays show the curiosity and interest of the problems dealt with in the text.”—<cite>Manchester
Guardian</cite>, Jan. 10, 1893.</p>
